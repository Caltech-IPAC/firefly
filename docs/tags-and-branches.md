# Release branches and tags

When we do a release we create a release branch and tag the commit for each version of the release in that branch.

When a release branch is created it is named by the current year and the release number of that year.  

_Example:_ The first release of 2019 will the `release-2019.1`, the next one will be `release-2019.2`

All the versions of that release will be tag using the same naming scheme but adding a version number at the end.

_Example:_ the release versions for the second 2019 release branch will be tagged. `release-2019.2.0`, `release-2019.2.1`, `release-2019.2.2`, etc. These tags will all be in the `release-2019.2` branch.
