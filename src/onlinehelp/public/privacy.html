<h2>Firefly: Notice to Users -- Privacy Notice</h2>


Firefly is software used to access astronomical data archives. Most of
Firefly's implementations (but not all of them!) are managed by the
NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA), which includes archives 
of images, catalogs, and spectra from multiple telescopes and
missions, managed by the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory.  This Web site is
maintained by the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC),
located on the campus of the California Institute of Technology
(Caltech).<P>

The information you provide on a Caltech Web site will be used only
for its intended purpose. We will protect your information consistent
with the principles of the Privacy Act, the e-Government act of 2002,
the Federal Records Act and, as applicable, the Freedom of Information
Act. This notice is posted pursuant to the California Online Privacy
Protection Act of 2003 (Cal Bus and Prof Code Sections 22575-22579).<P>

Submitting information is strictly voluntary. By doing so, you are
giving Caltech your permission to use the information for the intended
purpose. In addition, Caltech may also furnish this information to
NASA at NASA's request. If you do not want to give Caltech permission
to use your information, simply do not provide it. However, not
providing certain information may result in Caltech's inability to
provide you with the information or services you desire.<P>

only share your information with a government agency if it relates to
that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Caltech/JPL never
creates individual profiles or gives your information to any private
organization.<P>
