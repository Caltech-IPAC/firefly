<h2>About Firefly</h2>

Firefly is an <a href="https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly"
target="_blank">open source <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>
framework of archive components.  It provides an interactive web user interface
for astronomers. It provides three major components: a table display, FITS/HiPS
image visualization, and 2D plots. All three highly interactive components can
work together using the same data model or separately to provide any combination
of interactivity among them. Firefly components provide an easy way to add
interactivity to an otherwise static web page.  <P>

The documentation here describes the components in generic terms. If
you have specific questions about a specific implementation of
Firefly, you may have to consult the documentation specifically
associated with that implementation.<P>
