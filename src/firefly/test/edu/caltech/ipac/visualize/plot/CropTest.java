/**
 * Created by zhang on 10/10/16.
 * This test class is to test the Crop class.  The sample file used for testing is f3.fits.  It is used to create a output file,
 * out_f3.fits.  Both f3.fits and out_f3.fits are stored in the firefly_test_data/edu/caltech/ipac/visualize/plot/.  The end to end test is
 * load the f3.fits and creates a cropped file in the fly.  The newly created outFits file is compared with out_f3.fits.  If the
 * assertion is failed, it means the bugs are introduced after this class is written.
 *
 * It is difficult to do a unit test for this kind cases.  We the end to end test is used instead.
