# Firefly Community Code of Conduct

The community of participants in open source Firefly projects is made up of members from
around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences.
It is through these differences that our community experiences success and
continued growth.

As members of the community:

- We will treat all people with respect and dignity and will provide a harassment and bullying-free environment. Our aim is to foster open, amicable discussion and debate by promoting questions, productive feedback and discourse. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, political or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
- We will respect the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.
- We welcome those interested in joining the community, and realize that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community.
- We will help the entire community follow the code of conduct, we would encourage you to privately and professionally address any concerns with the original author or the maintainers.

This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and offline,
including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences, meetings,
associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.

This code of conduct has been adapted and summarised from the [Astropy Code of Conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html).
