<h2>About the Spitzer Heritage Archive </h2>
<br>
<br>
This is the version 2.0 release of the Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA)
interface. It currently provides access to <em>all</em> Spitzer data,
those from the Cryogenic and Warm Mission eras; passwords are needed
for access to data that are still proprietary. <strong>The SHA has
replaced Leopard as the interface to all Spitzer data in Fall
2010.</strong> New in this version is an "Inventory Search", which
provides access to the <a class="legacy"
href="http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/spitzermission/observingprograms/legacy/">Legacy
Enhanced Products</a> which have been delivered to the SSC and
ingested into IRSA.

<P align="center"><h2>About Spitzer</h2>

The Spitzer Space Telescope (formerly SIRTF, the Space Infrared
Telescope Facility), was launched into an earth-trailing orbit on 25
August 2003. Consisting of a 0.85-meter telescope and three science
instruments, at the time of its launch, Spitzer was the largest
infrared telescope ever launched into space. During the cryogenic
mission, the instruments aboard Spitzer (IRAC, IRS and MIPS) obtained
images and spectra at wavelengths between 3 and 180 microns, with
spatial resolution ranging from 2 arcseconds at the shortest
wavelengths to 40 arcseconds at the longest. Spitzer is still
currently taking data with IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5 during the Warm Mission
Era.  <a  class="about-page-small" href="http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu"
