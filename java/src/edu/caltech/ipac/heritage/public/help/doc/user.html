<h3>User Registration for the Spitzer Heritage Archive</h3>

While you certainly <b>do not have to register</b> to search the
archive, download data, analyze it, and write a paper, you may wish to
register so that the archive remembers you, your searches, and your
preferences. <P>

On the other hand, <strong><em>if you have proprietary data, you will
need to log in</em></strong> so that the system grants you access to
your data. If you got email from the Spitzer helpdesk about account
information, you may already have an account; else you can set up an
account (see below).  Once you have set up an account, please send us
an email at the Spitzer helpdesk and we'll tie your new account to
your proprietary data.  <P>

<A NAME="signin"><!-- --></A><H3>Sign In</H3>

The "sign in" link is in the far top right of the SHA page.<P>

Password</H3>

If you do not remember your username or password, select this option

To return to searching without making changes, click the "back" button
