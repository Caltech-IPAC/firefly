<h3>The Details Pane: Getting More Information on a Search Results Row
from the Spitzer Heritage Archive</h3>

After you have <a href="searching.html">searched the archive</A> and
<a href="results.html">explored the tabs in your search results</A>,
you might be interested in understanding the additional information
that appears on the right side of your screen when a row in the table
(for any tab) is highlighted.  You can click and drag the divider
between the window panes to resize them, or in several cases, you can
click on the expand icon (<img src="expand.gif">) to expand that pane
to take up the whole browser window. To collapse it back, click on
"Close" in the upper left.<P>

The contents of the Details pane change according to which tab you
have in the foreground, and which row you have selected. <P>

Depending on which tab you have in the foreground in the Details pane
when you click on a different tab in the Results pane, or which tab
you have already examined, you may end up with an "extra" tab in the
Details pane, e.g., one more than is described here.  This is the SHA
trying to be helpful, preserving a vestige of what you were doing
prior to changing tabs.<P>

<em>Contents:</em><br>

<A NAME="details"><!-- --></A><H3>Details Tab</H3>

From any results tab, click on any row (note: no need to select the
checkbox on the far left of the row). The row becomes highlighted in
green. The details pane on the right side of the window changes
accordingly. If it's not already, select the "Details" tab. The
Details tab contains information about whatever line you have selected
in the results pane.  <P>

For <b>AORs</b>, it starts with a section that contains the original program
title, program name, primary science category, principal investigator,
and abstract.  You can use this information to understand what the
original observer was trying to achieve with these observations --
e.g. if they were attempting to observe bright things, it may be
unlikely that you will be able to use those observations alone to
study faint things. <P>

The rest of the Details tab contains additional technical information
about the observation, such as the AORKEY (a large integer that
uniquely identifies this observation in the SHA) and the observing
mode parameters that defined this observation (such as frame time and
dither pattern).  More information about these parameters and their
available values for any given instrument or mode can be found at the
<a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/"
target="_blank">Spitzer Heritage Documentation website at IRSA</A>.<P>

For <b>Level 1 or Level 2 data</b>, the Details tab contains technical
information about the specific data frame or data product you have
selected in the results pane. You can use this information to help
decide if you are interested in finding out more about this frame or
product, or deciding to download it. Most of the values that appear
there should be self-explanatory from the name or from the tool tips
that appear when you let your mouse hover over the name.  Much of the
information that appears there is also information that can be found
in the FITS header of the corresponding FITS file; for a full view of
the FITS header, see the <a href="#data">Data tab</A>, specifically
some of the visualization options that appear in that tab. <P>

For <b>IRS Enhanced Products</b>, the Details tab contains technical
information about the specific data product selected.<P>

For <b>Contributed Enhanced Products</b>, you need to click on one of
the projects first, and then you are taken to a list of all the
returned products from that project. From there, you can select a row,
and get a Details tab with information about that product.<P>



<A NAME="data"><!-- --></A><H3>Data Tab</H3>

From ANY results tab, click on any row (note: no need to select the
checkbox on the far left of the row). The row becomes highlighted in
green. The details pane on the right side of the window changes
accordingly. Select the "Data" tab.<P>

<strong>NOTE: this tab shows you actual data.</strong><P>

For <b>AORs</b>, the Data tab will either not appear, or retain its
values from whatever you were last looking at.<P>

For <b>Level 1 or Level 2 images</b>, the Data tab shows you the
actual data frame corresponding to the file you have selected. There
are a variety of display options that can be configured via the image
options icon (<img src="imageoptions.gif">).  Further discussion of
these can be found on the <a href="visualization.html">Visualization
Help Page</A>. <P>

For <b>Level 1, Level 2, or IRS enhanced spectra</b>, the Data tab
shows you the actual spectrum pulled from the file you have selected. 
In the case of IRS Level 1 or Level 2 data, both images and spectra
are viable products; the "File Type" column in the AOR pane tells you
whether the file is an image or a table, and thus whether  to expect
an image or a spectrum to appear when selecting the Data tab. All of
the IRS enhanced products are spectra, and so the spectrum viewer will
always appear.<P>

Discussion of all of the options for the spectrum viewer can be found on the <a
href="visualization.html#spectrum">Visualization Help Page</A>. <P>


For <b>Contributed Enhanced Products</b>, you need to click on one of
the projects first, and then you are taken to a list of all the
returned products from that project. From there, you can select a row,
and get a Details pane that includes a Data tab, from which you can
investigate that product.<P>


You can click and drag the divider between the window panes to resize
them, or  you can click on the expand icon (<img src="expand.gif">) to
expand that pane to take up the whole browser window. To collapse it
back, click on "Close" in the upper left.<P>


(<a href="visualization.html">More information on visualization options</A>.)<P>



<A NAME="aorcoverage"><!-- --></A><H3>AOR DoC Tab</H3>

From the AOR tab, click on any row (note: no need to select the
checkbox on the far left of the row). The row becomes highlighted in
green. The details pane on the right side of the window changes
accordingly. Select the "AOR DoC" tab. <P>

The AOR DoC tab shows you the depth of coverage (DoC) of the selected
observations, e.g., how many individual frames were observed on each
patch of sky.  For any given AOR, the exposure time of an individual
frame is [largely] the same for a given channel; the DoC tells you the
number of <em>frames</em>, so the DoC is directly related to the total
integration time per patch of sky.  To find what that exposure time
was, examine the information in the <a href="#details">Details
tab</A>.<P>

<B>IMPORTANT NOTE</B>: The DoC is <em>counting frames</em> that were
<em>actually observed</em>. This may sound simple, but it can be
complicated. If your observation has frames of a variety of exposure
times (e.g., certain long IRAC integrations sometimes have a short
initial exposure for reasons related to instrumental effects), you
will see an "additional" frame in the DoC.  Since the DoC calculation
works from the actual pipeline-processed data, it may have
"additional" frames compared to a Spot visualization, since Spot was
estimating what would be observed, as opposed to working from what was
observed. If you have questions, please consult the corresponding
Instrument Handbook, or <a href="more.html">contact us</A>.<P>

The top of the AOR DoC window shows the zoom factor, and the wavelength to
which it refers. You can scroll between bandpasses if more than one
were obtained in the observation you are inspecting.<P>

There are a variety of display options that can be configured via the
image options icon (<img src="imageoptions.gif">).  Further discussion
of these can be found on the <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization Help Page</A>. <P>

This tab is "sticky", meaning that once you look at it once, it
sticks around. You have to be somewhat careful - it will automatically
update if you, say, pick another row in the AOR tab, but if you are in
one of the other tabs, this tab will not go away, and not update. Note
that it doesn't have any physical meaning in the enhanced product
tabs.<P>

(<a href="visualization.html">More information on visualization options</A>.)<P>


<A NAME="aorfootprint"><!-- --></A><H3>AOR Footprint Tab</H3>

From the AOR tab, click on any row (note: no need to select the
checkbox on the far left of the row). The row becomes highlighted in
green. The details pane on the right side of the window changes
accordingly. Select the "AOR Footprint" tab.<P>

The AOR Footprint tab is meant to show you the specific region of sky
that was covered by the selected single AOR. Note that this is the
entire observation, all bandpasses.  The background image that comes
up by default is automatically selected (you can change it), and the
outline of the observation (its "footprint") is drawn on the
image.<P>

There are a variety of display options that can be configured via the
image options icon (<img src="imageoptions.gif">).  Further discussion
of these can be found on the <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization Help Page</A>. <P>

The top of the AOR Footprint window shows the AORKEY corresponding to
the visualized AOR, the source (and wavelength) of the background
image used, and the zoom factor.<P>

(<a href="visualization.html">More information on visualization options</A>.)<P>




<A NAME="datacvg"><!-- --></A><H3>Data Coverage Tab</H3>

From just about any tab other than the AOR tab, click on any row (note:
no need to select the checkbox on the far left of the row). The row
becomes highlighted in green. The details pane on the right side of
the window changes accordingly. Select the "Data Coverage" tab.<P>

<strong>NOTE: this tab shows you portions of the sky covered by the
ALL the files that are displayed in a given page.</strong> This is one
of the most common confusions about this tab. Note that it is not all
the search results (if you have more than one page), and it is not
just the single row you have selected. <P>

The Data Coverage tab shows you the portion of sky that is actually
covered by the screenful of files you have displayed. This is
different from the AOR Footprint tab in that the AOR Footprint tab
shows you the portion of sky observed by just the entire single AOR
that you have highlighted.  <P>

The background image that comes up by default is automatically
selected (you can change it), and the outlines of <b>all the
observations in the window</b> are drawn on the image. The specific
one corresponding to the row you have selected is highlighted in a
different color. (You have some control over which
colors are available for these overlays.) <P>
 
You can use this feature, for example, to determine the portion of a
large map that you wish to download and further analyze, or the
specific frame that hits a bright star, etc.<P>

<b>Note that the Data Coverage will just show the pointings
corresponding to the files listed in your current window!</b> If you
have 72 files returned but are only looking at 50 at a time, then only
the first 50 will be visualized.  To see the full AOR coverage, use
the AOR Footprint tab, or increase your page size (see <a
href="results.html#newcolumns">text here</A>), and/or impose <a
href="results.html#filter">filters</A>.<p>

For <b>Contributed Enhanced Products</b>, you need to click on one of
the projects first, and then you are taken to a list of all the
returned products from that project. From there, you can select a row,
and get a Details pane that includes a Data Coverage tab, from which
you can investigate the sky coverage of that product.<P>



You can click and drag the divider between the window panes to resize
them, or  you can click on the expand icon (<img src="expand.gif">) to
expand that pane to take up the whole browser window. To collapse it
back, click on "Close" in the upper left.<P>

There are a variety of display options that can be configured via the
image options icon (<img src="imageoptions.gif">), including the
ability to change some of the default colors of the overlays.  Further
discussion of these can be found on the <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization Help Page</A>. <P>
