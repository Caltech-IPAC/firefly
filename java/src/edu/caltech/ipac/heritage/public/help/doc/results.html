<h3>Understanding Your Search Results from the Spitzer Heritage Archive</h3>


This page is an overview of what exactly is returned by a Spitzer
Heritage Archive (SHA) search. After terminology and a general
description of some common options, including how to download data,
the individual tabs are discussed, and then we discuss how to further
refine the search results by imposing filters.<P>

<A NAME="terminology"><!-- --></A><H3>Terminology</H3>

This is the Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA).<P>

An individual Spitzer observation sequence is an <em>AOR, or
Astronomical Observation Request</em>.  In certain cases (often
calibration or sometimes science observations), you may also see an
<em>IER, or Instrument Engineering Request</em>.  Either one involves
many individual frames.<P>

The individual data frames that emerged, calibrated, from the
Spitzer pipeline are <em>Level 1, or Basic Calibrated Data, or
BCDs</em>. <P>

The products that come from combining these individual data frames
(such as mosaics of individual pointings) are <em>Level 2, or
post-BCD, or PBCD data</em>.<P>

<em>Enhanced Products</em> come from combining AORs or doing post
processing (such as synthetic photometry from spectra or source
extraction from images). These can be contributed by the community, or
generated by the SSC itself.<P>


<A NAME="commonoptions"><!-- --></A><H3>Common Options</H3>

<dl>
<dt><em>Downloading Data</em>
<dd>In order to download data, click on the checkbox to
the left of the entry you want to download, and then click on the
"Prepare Download" button at the top of the column. (Select all of
them at once by clicking the checkbox at the top of that column.) The
<a href="downloads.html">Background Monitor</A> is then launched to
prepare your data for download. When your packaged data are ready,
save your data to disk. (The <a
href="#contribenhprod">Contributed Enhanced Products</A> are a
little different; see below.)<P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. For some overly
helpful browsers and small downloads, it may appear to have not done
anything; it just did it transparently quickly.<P>

<em>Red lines</em> -- some searches may return lines that are shaded
red. These data cannot be downloaded because they are still
proprietary. If they are your data, <a href="user.html">log in</A> and
you should be able to download them.  If they are not your data, you
can download those data after they become public, usually about 12
months after they were taken.  You can add the release date as one of
the <a href="#newcolumns">additional columns to display</A> in the
search results pane.<P>

<dt><a name="restrictingdata"><em>Restricting data in other
tabs</em></A> <dd>By default, the search results come up with a list
of <b>all</b> returned AORs in the AOR tab and a list of <b>a lot</b>
of corresponding files in the Level 1 and Level 2 tabs -- and it can
be a <b>long</b> list -- for ALL of those AORs.  These specific files
vary according to the observation; they include the pipeline products
such as a mosaic or extracted spectrum that is probably the primary
goal of your search.  If you want to limit exactly which files are
listed in the Level 1 and Level 2 tabs, be sure that the "Restrict
data in other tabs" box is checked (it should be by default) and then
check the box in the row you want to examine.  This is most
conceptually straightforward if you select an AOR entry and then
examine all of the Level 1 and/or 2 files that correspond specifically
to that AOR, as opposed to selecting one of the subsidiary files and
then going to another tab, though it works that way too.<P>

<b>Note that</b> the enhanced products tabs are different. The SHA
can't take you back to the AORs form the contributed products (since
some were created from intermediate processing versions).<P>

<dt><em>Saving the results</em>
<dd>The search results can be saved to a text file by clicking the
"Save" button or viewed as a text file by clicking the "Text View"
button. Various information is included in the header of the file to
give some indication of the origin of the search.<P>

<dt><em>Filtering</em>
<dd>Filters can be added interactively -- see <a
href="#filter">Filtering</A> below for more information.<P>

<dt><a name="newcolumns"><em>Adding/removing columns or rows</em></A>
<dd>Several columns come up in each of these tabs by default, and the
default number of rows returned is 50 per page. These values can be
changed by clicking on the small grid on the far upper
right of the corresponding tab's columns (<img src="addcols.gif">). If
you can't see this icon, it may be that the results pane is too small;
grab the divider between panes and slide it to the right until you can
see this icon. <P>

Note that the entire set of results can be sorted alphabetically by
clicking on any column's name.<P>

You can scroll through pages by the arrows on the top center of the
search results and see how many rows there are total via the count
indicated there.  Do you have "too many rows" to easily sift through? 
Further restrict the search by imposing additional <a
href="#filter">filtering</A>; see below!<P>

Note that expanding the page size to numbers much greater than 50 may
result in a substantial performance degradation (e.g., your browser
will appear to freeze or not be doing anything while it manages and
renders the large table). <P>


<dt><em>Getting more information on any row</em> 
<dd>Letting your mouse hover over many items will reveal some
information in a "tool tip".  Selecting any of the table entries
results in different items appearing in the <a
href="details.html">Details Pane</A>.  Please see that page for more
information.<P>


<dt><em>Changing the size of the window or columns</em>
<dd>You can click and drag the divider between the columns or window
pane. There is also a pair of black arrows (<img src="expand.png">)
that appears in the upper right corner of any window pane when your
mouse hesitates; clicking on that expands the window to take up the
whole browser window. To return to the prior view, click "Close" in
or "Collapse" the upper left corner of the expanded view. <P>

</dl>

<A NAME="aor"><!-- --></A><H3>Observation (AOR) Tab</H3>

(An individual Spitzer observation is an <em>AOR, or Astronomical
Observation Request</em>; see <a
href="#terminology">terminology</A> above.)<P>

Each AOR that was found via your <a href="searching.html">search</A>
is returned here in this tab. Because each AOR can result in
<em>many</em> other files, this AOR tab is the best place to start
browsing!  (The other tabs -- Level 1 and Level 2 -- will have more
additional files listed per AOR, and once you download the data,
you'll have even more files that come with the download. The enhanced
products will have a different sort of diversity of files, depending
on which products are available.)<P>

<em>Column Headings</em>:<P>

<UL>

<LI>The target name was supplied by the original observer and may be
enlightening or cryptic. <P>

<LI>The RA and Dec are the target of the AOR as observed.  <P>

<LI>If the object was observed as a moving target, the NAIF ID is
listed; otherwise, this is blank.<P>

<LI>The instrument and observing mode are listed next.<P>

<LI>The AORKEY is a large integer that uniquely identifies this
observation in the SHA. <P>

<LI>The AOR label was supplied by the original observer and may be clear
or it may be cryptic. <P>

<LI>The Observation start time is the time, in UT, that the observation
was begun.<P>

<LI>The Program ID is the integer identifier for the program under which
these observations were obtained.<P>

<LI>The Principal Investigator (PI) for these data is listed last in the
default display.<P>

<LI>An additional column can be added which indicates whether the
observation was an AOR or an IER; other columns can be added as well.
(click on <img src="addcols.gif"> at the top right of the tab window
to do this.)<P>

</UL>

Do you have "too much data" in the subsidiary search result tabs?  See
<a href="#restrictingdata">restricting data in other tabs</A> --
for example, limit the Level 1 and Level 2 tabs to be just the files
from one AOR.  Do you have "too many rows"?  Further restrict the
search by imposing additional <a href="#filter">filtering</A> -- for
example, limiting it to be just IRAC channel 1 data.  <em>In summary,
restricting data in other tabs means selecting the checkbox for a row
of the table and seeing the files corresponding to that row in the
other tabs, whereas filtering corresponds to limiting the rows to
specific values in the columns.</em>  <P>

<A NAME="bcd"><!-- --></A><H3>Level 1 (BCD) Tab</H3>

(The individual data frames that emerge [calibrated] from the
Spitzer pipeline are <em>Level 1, or Basic Calibrated Data, or
BCDs</em>; see <a
href="#terminology">terminology</A> above.)<P>

Each AOR that was returned by your <a href="searching.html">search</A>
can result in <em>many</em> other files.  This Level 1 (BCD) tab
contains all of the BCDs  that correspond to the AORs returned (or
selected) in the AOR tab. (Additional Level 1 products will arrive
with your download, such as errors and masks.)<P>

<em>Column Headings</em>:<P>

<UL>

<LI>The AORKEY is a large integer that uniquely identifies this
observation in the SHA. (Note that each AOR results in many files, and
that you can restrict the contents of this tab to be just those files
corresponding to one AOR; see <a href="#restrictingdata">"Restricting
data in other tabs" above</A>.)<P>

<LI>The BCD ID is a large integer that uniquely identifies this
particular file in the SHA. <P>

<LI>The instrument and observing mode are listed next.<P>

<LI>The specific bandpass of this individual file is in the next
column.<P>

<LI>The RA and Dec are listed in hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss format.  If "no
data" or other unusual values appear here, this is most likely a
calibration file.<P>

<LI>The exposure time corresponding to this file is given in
seconds.<P>

<LI>Particularly in the case of MIPS, the arrays may be on and
collecting data even if the telescope is being used to observe using
one of the other fields of view in the instrument.  For any given row,
if the telescope was optimized for use of the field of view to which
the specific file applies, then the "primary field" column is 1; other
values indicate that this is serendipitous data.  See the MIPS
Instrument Handbook (available on the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/" target="_blank">IRSA
Spitzer website</A>) for more information on how to use these data.<P>

<LI>Since there can be files at the BCD level that are not images
(such as tables of data), the "File Type" column lists the nature of
the file. "Image" will be the most common.<P>

<LI>The file name of the corresponding file once it is unpacked and
resident on your disk is listed.  The filename contains information
about the instrument, channel, and originating AOR as well as the
specific contents of the file; see the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/" target="_blank">IRSA
Spitzer website</A>, specifically the Instrument Handbooks, for a comprehensive
listing of the files available at the BCD level (Level 1). <P>

<LI>Several additional columns can be added to the BCD view.  Most of
these should be self-explanatory from the column headers (or the tool
tips) appearing in the pop-up window that appears when you add columns
(<a href="#commonoptions">see more information on options found in
every tab</A> -- in brief, click on <img src="addcols.gif"> at the top
right of the tab window). <P>

href="#terminology">terminology</A> above.)<P>

Each AOR that was returned by your <a href="searching.html">search</A>
can result in <em>many</em> other files.  This Level 2 (post-BCD) tab
contains all of the Level 2 products that correspond to the AORs
returned (or selected) in the AOR tab. (Additional Level 2 products
will arrive with your download, such as errors and coverage maps.)<P>

the file. "Image" will be the most common; IRS data results in a lot
of tables.<P>

<LI>The file name of the corresponding file once it is unpacked and

about the instrument, channel, and originating AOR as well as the
specific contents of the file; see the <a

<H3><A NAME="filter"><!-- --></A>Filtering -- Imposing additional
filters to get the most out of your search results</H3>

Even if your search returned only one AOR, you could have 
<em>many</em> files that appear in the Level 2 (PBCD) or Level 1 (BCD)
tabs.  In order to quickly weed through what files appear in the tab
and find/examine the file you care about, <em>filtering</em> is a very
powerful tool. <P>

Click on "Add filters" in order to add a new filter. Each of your
current columns can be selected in a pulldown menu, as well as an
operation (=, <, etc).  If you select a field with a limited set of
choices, an additional pulldown appears with those limited choices.<P>

For example, if you have searched on an IRAC AOR and would like to
only view the files relevant to the 3.6 micron channel, select
'Bandpass', '=', and 'IRAC 3.6 um' from the relevant pulldowns, then
"ADD" the filter and "APPLY" it to your search results. Then, the
number of files is restricted, and the notice on the top right of the
search results pane reminds you that there has been a filter applied.
<P>

You can add additional filters to further restrict your list of
files.  Note that, at this time, the filters are logically "AND"ed
together -- that is, if you impose "Bandpass=IRAC 3.6 um" and
Bandpass="IRAC 4.5 um", no data will result, because no data are both
3.6 and 4.6 microns at the same time. If you want to see just the 3.6
and 4.5 micron data, ask it to give you all bandpasses less than 5.8
microns, e.g., "Bandpass", "<", and "IRAC 5.8 um".  <P>

A more complex but still common application of filters would be
downloading all the most recent data from a given program (e.g., data
from one program that have just been released). To do this: Search by
campaign for the most recent campaign. Many AORs will be returned. 
Once the results appear, click on "add filters". Click on "Program ID"
from the first drop-down menu. Leave the operator as the default "=".
Enter the program ID you want. Apply the filter and close the filters
window. Just the AORs from that campaign and that program will
remain.<P>

NOTE THAT the filters as imposed this way only apply to your current
tab, <em>even if "restrict data in other tabs" is selected</em>!  (See
<a href="#restrictingdata">"Restricting data in other tabs" above</A>
for more information on this option -- <em>in summary, restricting data in
other tabs means selecting the checkbox for a row of the table and
seeing the files corresponding to that row in the other tabs, whereas
filtering corresponds to the values in the columns.</em>)<P>

The available logical operators are :
<UL>
<LI> =  which means 'equal to' (exactly!), e.g., the parameter on
which I am querying (such as "Bandpass") is exactly equal to this value I
am specifying (such as "IRAC 3.6um" from the pulldown).
<LI> &gt; which means 'greater than'
<LI> &lt; which mean 'less than'
<LI> != which means 'not equal to' (exactly!)
<LI> &gt;= which means 'greater than or equal to'
<LI> &lt;= which means 'less than or equal to'
<LI> IN which means 'included within this list', e.g., the parameter 
on which I am querying (such as "Bandpass") is included within the
list I am specifying (such as, from the list of bandpasses provided,
where more than one can be selected by holding down the command key
and clicking on the bands desired)
</UL>

See the full SHA PDF manual, available at the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/" target="_blank">IRSA Spitzer
site</A>, for more examples.<P>

<A NAME="tagging"><!-- --></A><H3>Tag It -- Tagging a search</H3>

Many of the papers published on Spitzer data include a list of all the
individual AORKEYs (the integer number corresponding uniquely to each
AOR) used for data discussed in that paper.  This provides an easy way
for readers to retrieve the data from the Spitzer archive, and links
can be made from ADS directly back to the SHA.<P>

However, many papers use many AORs.  Data tagging allows you to
customize the data set you use so that the link back from ADS (or
embedded in your paper itself) refers to a single unique identifier
that corresponds to all your data. (That is, a single identifier, as
opposed to a potentially long list of AORKEYs.)<P>

You yourself (independent of any publications) may also wish to repeat
a search later on for any of a number of reasons. Tagging a search
means that you can easily recreate later.

Once you have established a search that you like and wish to repeat in
the future, click on the blue "History/Tags" tab near the top of the
browser window, then click on the "Tags" tab.  At this point, you can
enter a name for your tag, then click on the "Tag It" button. It will
then return the tag URL you can save and distribute. It also appears
in your tagging history. If you have <a href="user.html">logged
in</A>, this tagging history is available to you any time you log into
the SHA (or in the future, any IRSA service).<P>

To recreate the search, highlight the tag row you want, and click on
the "Resubmit Search" button. To remove it, click on the "Remove"
button.<P>


<A NAME="irsenh"><!-- --></A><H3>IRS Enhanced Products Tab</H3>

(<em>Enhanced Products</em> come from combining AORs or doing post
processing; see <a href="#terminology">terminology</A> above. The SSC
has generated enhanced products for IRS.</em>)<P>

The SSC has generated enhanced products for the IRS observations in
the Archive. For complete documentation on these products (how they
were generated, etc.), please see the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irs/"
target="_blank">IRS Instrument Handbook</A>, available at the IRSA
website. <P>

If there is an IRS enhanced product available that meets your search
criteria, it is shown in the "IRS Enhanced" tab. Many columns are
shown, including extraction information, observation information,
synthetic photometry for a variety of bands, and links to a merged
spectrum.<P>

<a href="#filter">Filtering</A> and <a href="#newcolumns">column
operations</A> (adding, removing, sorting) work in exactly the same
way as they do through the rest of the SHA.<P>

Selecting any of the table entries results in different items
appearing in the <a href="details.html#irsenh">Details Pane</A>, and
the related tabs.  Please see that page for more information.<P>


<A NAME="contribenhprod"><!-- --></A><A NAME="contribenh"><!-- --></A><H3>Contributed Enhanced Products Tab</H3>

(<em>Enhanced Products</em> come from combining AORs or doing post
processing; see <a href="#terminology">terminology</A> above. The
community has contributed many enhanced products to the archive.</em>)<P>

Most of the enhanced products currently available via the SHA come
from the deliveries made back to IRSA from the Legacy Teams. (<a
href="searching.html#enhanced">More on enhanced product
searching</A>.) <P>

In response to a search, the Contributed Products Results tab comes up
with a "Summary View" of the search results.  By default, the results
are grouped by type -- images, catalogs, or spectra.  You can also
choose to sort the results by originating project.  <P>

The images come up quickly, and the summary page indicates how many
images from each project are returned. Note that sometimes this could
mean one image for each band, or it could mean image, errors, and
coverage for each band, or it could mean multiple resamplings of the
same bands, etc. To investigate exactly what images are available,
click on the first link in each line, the one corresponding to the
delivering project's name.  Additional tabs are spawned for each
click, containing a summary of the contents of each image or catalog.
You can make those tabs go away when you are done with them by
clicking on the x that appears when you put your mouse on the tab.<P>

Please consult the original documentation that came with the delivery
for definitions, explanations, and caveats that might go with each
product. Note that some teams delivered, e.g., GALEX and Halpha
images, so you may obtain non-Spitzer data from the Spitzer Heritage
Archive! The delivery documentation can be found on the project's page
in IRSA, which can be obtained by clicking the second link in each
line in the summary, the one that tells you more about the
delivery.<P>

Catalogs come up more slowly (because they are harder to search!), and
depending on your search, the SHA may tell you that it has completed
searching on "8 of 10 catalogs" or a similar phrase. Here too, the
catalog contents vary across projects, and even between deliveries
within the same project.  In the case of the catalogs, the "count"
tells you how many individual catalog entries there are in that
catalog for your search parameters. Click on the first link in each
line, the one corresponding to the delivering project's name, to spawn
an additional tab with the catalog values. Note that by default, only
50 lines are shown, but as these catalogs can be very long, it may
take a second or two to read in and render. The catalog columns as
displayed are exactly as provided by the original Legacy team (with
some additional columns added by IRSA to reformat the RA/Dec into
standard options), so the columns are effectively different for each
catalog. Please consult the original documentation that came with the
delivery for column definitions, caveats, etc. Such information can be
found on the project's page in IRSA, which can be obtained by clicking
the second link in each line in the summary, the one that
tells you more about the delivery.<P>

<b>NOTE:</b>  Currently, the Contributed Products search
performs a cone search of the IRSA holdings, and if you go to IRSA
directly to do what seems to be the identical search on the same
source material, it does a box search. This will result in some
apparent inconsistencies (e.g., different numbers of images or
sources) as a result of the corners of the box search area.<P>

For a complete background on the Legacy program, information on
individual programs, and information on individual deliveries, please
click the link that appears next to each project's entry on the
summary.  This will take you to the IRSA page corresponding
to the project, from which you can learn more about the project and
its deliveries.<P>

Visualization here is similar to <a
href="visualization.html">visualization elsewhere in the SHA</A>. You
can investigate the observation coverage and overlay catalogs on
an image.<P>
