<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the Spitzer Heritage
Archive (SHA)</h3>

<h3>Interface questions</h3>

<dl>
<dt>What does SHA/AOR/IER/BCD/PBCD/Level 1/Level 2 mean?
<dd>Here are some common definitions. This is the Spitzer Heritage
Archive (SHA). An individual Spitzer observation sequence is an AOR,
or Astronomical Observation Request. In certain cases (often
calibration or sometimes science observations), you may also see an
IER, or Instrument Engineering Request. Either one involves many
individual frames. The individual data frames that emerge, calibrated,
from the Spitzer pipeline are Level 1, or Basic Calibrated Data, or
BCDs. The products that come from combining these individual data
frames (such as mosaics of individual pointings) are Level 2, or
post-BCD, or PBCD data. Enhanced products come from combining AORs or
doing post processing (such as synthetic photometry from spectra or
source extraction from images). These can be contributed by the
community, or generated by the SSC itself.<P>
<P>

<dt>What's the file format that I need to use for the search-by-file
upload?
<dd>See <a
href="http://sha.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Spitzer/SHA/help/doc/searching.html#byBatch">discussion
here</A>.<P>

<dt>Why am I getting search results that are shaded red, which I can't
download?
<dd>The red-shaded data are still proprietary.  If they are your data,
then log in and you should be able to download them. If they are not
your data, you can download those data after the data become public,
usually about 12 months after the data were taken (usually 12
months after the data were released to the observers). You can add the
release date as one of the additional fields to display in the search
results pane.<P>

<dt>How do I download all of the data shown at once?
<dd>Click on the checkbox at the top of the column of checkboxes, at
the top left of the search results pane.<P>

<dt>How come I can't make a 3-color image from Spitzer data I am
exploring interactively?
<dd>The visualization tools currently only allow you to create 3-color
images that you load from disk or from the web. If you want to create
3-color images using Spitzer data, download the data to disk and then
load them into the SHA from disk as individual color planes.  Creating
3-color images within the SHA itself is on the wish list for future
versions. <P>

<dt>I know that there are a lot more files that should come as part of
Level 1 (BCD) or Level 2 (PBCD) data. How come I can't see them in the
Level 1 or 2 tabs?
<dd> Yes, there are a lot more files than what are shown, such as the
errors! We decided for clarity that only certain files of primary
interest to users would appear for individual examination in the SHA
interface, but of course the download includes many more files -- you
don't even have to tell it to include ancillary products. The IRAC,
IRS, and MIPS Instrument Handbooks list (and define) all of the files
that are included in the downloads.<P>

<dt>I know that there are a lot more files that should come as part of
Level 1 (BCD) or Level 2 (PBCD) data. How come they didn't come with
my download?
<dd> There are some files that we have tagged 'primary' (e.g., of
greatest interest to someone coming to use Spitzer data for the first
time), and some files that we have tagged 'secondary' or 'ancillary'.
If you are trying to find a file that does not appear to have come
with your download, please be sure that you have clicked "include
ancillary data" when preparing your download.<P>

<dt>I did a search, left the SHA window up, and now that I've come
back to this session, it's in a funny state and does not appear to be
responding as it should. Why?
<DD>Sometimes, if there is a network hiccup (e.g., you pick up and
move your laptop to a different wireless hub), the SHA can be left in
a funny state. To avoid this, if you've accomplished a complex search,
log in to the SHA and save or tag the search. That way, you can
recover it easily with a single click the next time you log in.<P>

<h3>File questions</h3>

<dl>
<dt>It broke up my request into, like, 30 zip files! Is there
any way I can get it in larger pieces, or somehow streamline the data
download? 
<dd>When downloading large quantities of data (big programs, whole
campaigns, etc.), the SHA will break up the downloads into
"manageable" pieces, where "manageable" is defined as "not larger than
common computers and software can handle." If you don't want to click
to download each piece, use the download script provided by the Background
Monitor. Obtain that script directly from the background monitor,
available when the packaging is complete, provided that you have more
than one package available for download.   To use this script, first ensure that
you have "wget" installed by typing "which wget" at a terminal prompt.
If you do not have it, download and install it from <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank">gnu.org</A>.  Save the wget
script to a plain text file, and invoke the wget lines from your plain
text file either by copying and pasting those lines individually into
your terminal window, or by  typing "csh [yourtextfile]" at the
prompt.  The files will be automatically and sequentially downloaded
to your disk. For more information (and information on, e.g., getting
this sort of script to work on Windows machines), please see the pdf
SHA documentation.<p>

<dt>How long do these zip files stick around on your disk after they
are prepared?
<dd>72 hours, sometimes longer if the SHA is not under heavy use.<P>

<dt>What do I do with the zip files I get when I download data?
<dd>To uncompress the files you have downloaded, type "unzip
foo.zip". To uncompress multiple files at once, type "unzip '*.zip'"
(the single quotes are important), or "unzip \*.zip" -- you just have
to escape out the wildcard. <P>

<dt>What is the file naming scheme for all these files?  Why do I have
so many files for a single observation?  Which files do I need to
download my data?
<dd>Each of the instruments (IRAC, IRS, and MIPS) has an Instrument
Handbook, which lists and defines each of the files.  They also
describe instrument artifacts, and give guidance as to how to reduce
the data.<P>

<dt>Why does my IRAC observation appear to have no post-BCD (Level 2)
data?
<dd>If the data was taken in IRAC's subarray mode, or for certain IERs
(Instrument Engineering Requests), there will be no post-BCD data for
the observation. Data in IRAC subarray mode are not processed through
the online post-BCD pipeline. The post-BCD pipeline was not designed
to work with the three-dimensional data cubes that are the subarray
BCDs. When the software was developed it was deemed unlikely that
subarray observations would be used for anything other than photometry
of single bright objects and mosaics would not be a desired product.
As a result, post-BCD products (e.g., mosaics and source lists) are
not available from the pipeline.  Please see the IRAC Instrument
Handbook for more information on dealing with subarray data.<P>

<dt>Where are my dmask files?
<dd>Pipeline products after S18.5 no longer provide dmasks as they
contain misleading and incomplete information. They have been
superseded by the information contained in the imask files. The
imasks are more robust, include flagging of various artifacts that are
not present in dmasks and make full use of the saturation correction
made by the pipeline. Please see the IRAC Instrument Handbook
(Appendix A) for more information.<P>
