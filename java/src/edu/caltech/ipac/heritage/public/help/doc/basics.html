<h3>Basic Features and Functions in the Spitzer Heritage Archive</h3>

This page is an overview of the basic features and functions of the
Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA); for an even faster overview, see the
<a href="quickguide.html">Quick-Start Guide</A>.  For more detailed
information on any of these topics, see the more detailed online help
on the left, or the much longer standalone documentation, available at

<A NAME="terminology"><!-- --></A><H3>Terminology</H3>

This is the Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA).<P>

An individual Spitzer observation sequence is an <em>AOR, or
Astronomical Observation Request</em>.  In certain cases (often
calibration or sometimes science observations), you may also see an
<em>IER, or Instrument Engineering Request</em>.  Either one involves
many individual frames.<P>

The individual data frames that emerge, calibrated, from the
Spitzer pipeline are <em>Level 1, or Basic Calibrated Data, or
BCDs</em>. <P>

The products that come from combining these individual data frames
(such as mosaics of individual pointings) are <em>Level 2, or
post-BCD, or PBCD data</em>.<P>

<em>Enhanced Products</em> come from combining AORs or doing post
processing (such as synthetic photometry from spectra or source
extraction from images). These can be contributed by the community, or
generated by the SSC itself.<P>



<A NAME="searching"><!-- --></A><H3>Spitzer Searches -- The basics of searching</H3>

Searching the archive is straightforward, and a wide variety of
options are available on the left hand side of the search window. The
search window can be retrieved after a search by clicking on the blue
"Spitzer Searches" tab near the top.  The position search is the most
commonly used search, and appears by default.  Target names can be
automatically resolved into coordinates using NED or SIMBAD, or you
can specify coordinates, and you specify the search radius.  There are
many more search options, described in detail <a
href="searching.html">on the page on searching</A>.<P>

Spitzer observations can cover large areas or, by design, multiple
targets. If you are interested in just portions of the larger
observation, you can choose to have just individual data products
returned -- e.g., just the observations that went into the portion of
the sky for which you searched -- or you can return the products for
the whole AOR.<P>

You can search for observations by instrument or by wavelength.<P>

The search results appear in up to five tabs: AORs, Level 1 (BCD),
Level 2 (PBCD), IRS Enhanced Products, and Contributed Enhanced
Products.  Each tab provides a different look at the data retrieved by
your search. (See the page on <a href="results.html">understanding
your search results</A> for more information.)<P>

You may wish to impose additional filters on your search results; see
<a href="results.html#filter">this page</A> for more information on
filtering.<P>

The tabs on the far right aid in visualizing exactly what data have
been retrieved. You can examine individual data frames, or see what
parts of the sky are covered by the retrieved AORs.  See the page on
<a href="details.html">the Details pane</A> for more information on
what is in each tab, and the page on  <a
href="visualization.html">visualization</A> for more information on
the options within the visualization tabs.<P> 

You can  also search all of the Contributed Enhanced Products returned
to the SSC and IRSA, largely by the Legacy teams.  Each team delivered
different products, ranging from images, catalogs, and spectra to
images beyond the Spitzer bands.  See <a
href="searching.html#enhanced">the enhanced products</A> discussion on
the searching page for more information.<P>

After deciding what data to download, click the checkboxes to pick
specific data files to download, and then click "Prepare Download" to
begin the  packaging and downloading process.  A pop-up window will
appear in order to define exactly what kinds of data you would like to
have packaged up. Clicking OK initializes this process.<P>

The Background Monitor appears as a link in the upper right of your
window to keep track of the data download.  A pop-up window can be
called up by clicking the "Background Monitor" link.  You can watch
your data being packaged, and when the data are available for
download, it will update that window, providing a link (or more than
one link) for downloading the packaged data. (<a
href="downloads.html">More on data downloads</A>.)<P>

<strong>Important note</strong>: don't log in while it is preparing a
download! If you log in during a download, as far as the system is
concerned, you have changed identities (from 'anonymous' to 'jones',
say), and as a result it does not complete preparing the download.<P>



<A NAME="searchHistory"><!-- --></A><H3>History/Tags -- Your search history and tag history</H3>

The History/Tags menu option gives you access to your own search
history and tag history.  By default, it comes up with the Search
History tab in the foreground; to access the Tag History, just
click on the "Tags" tab.<P>

<DL>
<DT><em>Your Search History</em><P>

<DD>All of the searches that you do for a given session with the archive
are remembered in the search history panel. A high-level summary of
the search is also listed -- what kind of search it was, what
parameters you used, and the number of AORs or IERs that it
returned.<P>

You can resubmit the search (see buttons at top left of the search
history tab), remove the search from your history, or save the search
as a favorite search to which you can return at a later time/date.
(However, you do need to be logged in when you save the search -- <a
href="user.html">more on user registration</A>.) <P>

<DT><em>Tags and Your Tagging History</em><P>

<DD>Many of the papers published on Spitzer data include a
list of all the individual AORKEYs (the integer number corresponding
uniquely to each AOR) used for data discussed in that paper.  This
provides an easy way for readers to retrieve the data from the Spitzer
archive, and links can be made from ADS directly back to the SHA.<P>

However, many papers use many AORs.  Data tagging allows you to
customize the data set you use so that the link back from ADS (or
embedded in your paper itself) refers to a single unique identifier
that corresponds to all your data. (That is, a single identifier, as
opposed to a potentially long list of AORKEYs.)<P>

Once you have established a search that you like, you can click on the
"Tag It" icon in the top right of the search results tabs. It will then ask
for a nickname, and then return the tag name for insertion into your
paper as well as a direct URL you can distribute. <P>

Once you have tagged a search, it appears in the "Tags" tab.<P>

</DL>

<a NAME="readfitsfile"><!-- --></A><H3>Read FITS file -- Reading in
FITS files</h3>

Powerful visualization tools were important to the original Spitzer
observation planning and archive tools (Spot and Leopard), and the
descendents of these tools are included in the SHA.  These tools can
be used to investigate images of any sort, of your disk or from a
variety of online resources, at IRSA or another website.<P>

Selecting the "Read FITS File" option from the blue tabs on top of the
SHA window results in a large visualization window, into which you can
load images from a variety of sources. A pop-up window appears with
the available image options. Please see the <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization page</A> for much more
information about the visualization environment, specifically what the
icons mean.  (Hovering with your mouse over an icon will also reveal a
"tool tip" to help figure out what each icon does.) <P>



<A NAME="preferences"><!-- --></A><H3>Preferences -- Setting and using your preferences</H3>

The preferences tab provides a few ways to customize your 
experience.  The window that appears when you click that option
gives you by default a choice of the number of entries that appear in
the table by default, allows you to enter your email for an email
notification when data are packaged, and allows you to select the
default for distance measurements.<P>

<a href="user.html">Log in</A> before setting these preferences, and
they will be preserved for you the next time you log in.<P>

<A NAME="help"><!-- --></A><H3>Getting Help</H3>

The "SHA Help" blue tab leads you into this online help, as does
"Spitzer Help" from under the "Help" in the IRSA (red) menu above.<P>

For an even faster overview, see the <a
href="quickguide.html">Quick-Start Guide</A>.  For more detailed
information on any of these topics, see the more detailed online help
on the left, or the much longer standalone documentation, available at
the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/spitzerdataarchives/"
target="_blank">IRSA
Spitzer site</A>.<P>

Please see <a href="more.html">this page</A> for more information on
getting more help, or contacting us.<P>

<A NAME="catalogs"><!-- --></A><H3>Catalogs -- Retrieving and using catalogs</H3>

(Note that this blue tab is only available after you have performed at
least one search.)<P> 

You can choose from any of a wide variety of catalogs to load in
preparation for overlaying on your <a
href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. First we cover catalogs
you can download from IRSA, then we cover <a href="#owncatalogs">using
your own catalogs</A>.<P>

By clicking on the "Catalog" menu option, a window appears with
several options, as follows.<P>

The target name is by default the one for the current search/AOR with
which you are working. If you would like to change the center of the
search for purposes of the catalog search, click on "modify target"
and enter the new information.  All of the same basic parameters as for a
position search of the SHA appear.<P>

You can then choose catalogs based first on the "project" under which
they are housed at IRSA, such as 2MASS, IRAS, Spitzer (includes
delivered enhanced product catalogs), MSX, etc.  The options under the
"category" and the specific clickable catalog on the right change
according to the project you have selected.  A short description is
provided for each of the catalogs, with links for more information.<P>

<A NAME="catColumn"><!-- --></A>
You can also set restrictions on specific columns by clicking on  "Set
Column Restrictions". A new window will open up with the available 
column names in the catalog, and you can filter what is returned, with
the same basic approach as in <a href="results.html#filter">filtering
your search results</A> in the rest of the SHA. All
the restrictions are  AND operators.<P>


Click on "Search" to initiate the search. <b>NOTE THAT</b> the search
may take a long time to return, especially if you have asked for a
large catalog, and you may think that nothing has happened, but be
patient and eventually it will return a tab.<P>

Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Searches that retrieve more rows
will take even longer.<P>

If the catalog search is successful, it will return the results in a
tab of its own, in an interface similar to the other data tabs. You
can save the catalog to your local disk for future use. <P> 

<a name="owncatalogs"><!-- --></A><b>Loading your own catalogs</b><P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for new catalogs. However, you can
pick another tab from the top left, "Load Catalog", to load your own
catalog.<P>

Your catalog needs to be in <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format</A>, which is a varietal of plain
text. IRSA has a <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblCheck/"
target="_blank">table reformatting and validation service</A> which
may be helpful, or you can download any catalog you find through the
SHA, and copy that format.<P>

Your table file MUST have RA and Dec values, and unless it is
specified, it assumes J2000.<P>

You can add a "SYMBOL" parameter to change the shape
(X, SQUARE, CROSS, EMP_CROSS, DIAMOND, DOT) of catalog marks, e.g.:
<pre>
\SYMBOL = X
</pre>
<P>

You can add a "DEFAULT_COLOR" parameter to assign a CSS color name or
a HEX value to catalog marks, e.g., either of these two:
<pre>
\DEFAULT_COLOR = lightcyan
\DEFAULT_COLOR = #00FF00
</pre>
You can find the <a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp"
target="_blank">CSS color code</A> or the <a 
href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colorsfull.asp"
target="_blank">CSS color HEX values</A> online.<P> 


<A NAME="downloads"><!-- --></A><H3>Downloads - Downloading data</H3>

On any search results page, you can click the checkboxes on the far
left of each row to pick specific data files to download, and then
click "Prepare Download" (near the top of the column of checkboxes) to
begin the packaging (and downloading) process.  A pop-up window will
appear in order to define exactly what kinds of data you would like to
have packaged up. Clicking OK initializes this process.  <P>

To select <em>all</em> of the data you have displayed, click on the
checkbox at the top of the column of checkboxes, and all of the rows
are automatically clicked (even those on subsequent pages).  Then
click "Prepare Download" to initiate the packaging process.<P>

The packaging process spins off into the <a
href="downloads.html#background">background monitor</A>, which keeps
track of its progress and can notify you when the downloads are
complete. You can choose to have an email sent to you to let you know
when things are ready. If you have just a few zip files, you can click
to download them, but especially if you have many files, you may want
to have the SHA generate a <a
href="downloads.html#downloadScript">downloading script</A> for you to
download them all automatically. <P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. <P>


For more information, see <a href="downloads.html">the page on
downloads</A>.<P>
