<a NAME="oveview"><!-- --></A><h3>Overview</h3>

After <a href="searching.html">searching</A> and <a
href="results.html">investigating your results</A>, you have decided
which data to download, and the next step is actually downloading
it.<P>

In the simplest case, just click the checkboxes on the far left of
each row to pick specific data files to download, and then click
"Prepare Download" to begin the packaging (and downloading) process. 
A pop-up window will appear in order to define exactly what kinds of
data you would like to have packaged up. Clicking OK initializes this
process.<P>

To select <em>all</em> of the data you have displayed, click on the
checkbox at the top of the column of checkboxes, and all of the rows
are automatically clicked (even those on subsequent pages).  Then
click "Prepare Download" to initiate the packaging process.<P>

From the pop-up window, you can enter an email at which you would like
to be notified when the packaging process is complete. <P>

The packaging process is spun off to the Background Monitor. Once the
packaging is complete, to download the data, just click on the
"Background Monitor" link, then click on any of the provided links
reading "Download Now".<P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. <P>

<H3>Deciding what files to download</h3>

All users should consult the corresponding Instrument Handbook
(available at the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/"
TARGET="_blank">IRSA Spitzer site</A>) for details and for information
to consider for your own project.<P>

Most new users probably will want the most highly processed data
versions available -- Enhanced Products first, then Level 2 (PBCD)
products. <P>

More experienced users, or users wanting more control over the
analysis (e.g., wanting highly accurate photometry), will want to
download the Level 1 (BCD) data. <P>

Very experienced users may want the Level 0 (raw) data. Choose this
option with caution!  Note also that some raw data was not included in
the generation of the final products. When selecting the 'raw data'
download option, <em>all</em> of the frames associated with your AORs
are downloaded, not just the ones, e.g., within a smaller search radius.<P>


<a NAME="background"><!-- --></A><h3>The Background Monitor</h3>

The Background Monitor appears as a link in the upper right of your
window to keep track of the data download.  It actively changes to
reflect what it is doing ("Preparing", etc.). <P>

A pop-up window can be called up at any time by clicking the
"Background Monitor" link (or "Preparing" link, etc).  You can watch
your data being packaged, and when the data are available for
download, it will update that window, providing a link (or more than
one link) for downloading the packaged data. It also provides a
download script (optional) if you have more than one package to
download.<P>

<strong>Important note</strong>: don't log in while it is preparing a
download! If you log in during a download, as far as the system is
concerned, you have changed identities (from 'anonymous' to 'jones',
say), and as a result it does not complete preparing the download.<P>

The Background Monitor also keeps track of very large catalog queries,
ones that take a long time to render in the SHA itself.<P>

To stop any query mid-way through, click on the little red octagon
("stop sign").<P>

If you forgot to put in your email at the beginning, or if the
packaging is taking longer than you expected, you can click on "Add
email" from the lower right of the Background Monitor popup and add
your email during the packaging process. <P>


<a name="manyzipfiles"><!-- --></A><h3>Help! I have a lot of
zipfiles!</h3>

When downloading large quantities of data (big programs, whole
campaigns, etc.), the SHA will break up the downloads into
"manageable" pieces, where "manageable" is defined as "not larger than
common computers and software can handle." We understand your
frustration if you computer is customized to handle much larger files
than the average computer. If you don't want to click to download each
piece, use the download script provided by the Background Monitor,
available when the packaging is complete either in the Monitor itself
or from the email you can arrange to have sent to you. The script can
be configured to unzip the files too.  See the next section for
instructions on how to use it.<P>

<a name="downloadScript"><!-- --></A><h3>Using the Download Scripts</h3>

The Download Retrieval Script dialog gives you some options regarding
which script you want to use. Generally speaking, the wget script is
best for Linux and Unix users. The curl script is best for Mac users,
because curl is part of the standard OS distribution; Mac users can
also go retrieve and install <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank">wget</A> and then use the
wget scripts. For any of the scripts, you can also choose to include
an option that unzips the zip files automatically.  The files stay on
disk here for at least 72 hours, so you have a window of time to
download them.<P>

Save the script to a plain text file, and invoke the script.  You can
copy and paste the script lines individually into your terminal
window, or by  typing "csh [yourtextfile]" at the prompt.  The files
will be automatically and sequentially downloaded to your disk, and if
you've selected that option, unzipped as well.  <P>

For Windows users, download and save the text file of URLs . Then follow the
following steps to install the wget script and then download your data:
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm" target="_blank">Windows wget web page</a>
<li>Scroll to the Download section and retrieve the wget installation.
<li>Install wget and add the binary to your path.
<li>Download the text file of URLs 
<li>At the command prompt: wget --content-disposition -i &lt;file_of_urls_downloaded.txt&gt;
</ol><P>

For more information about the subtleties and choices here, please see
the SHA PDF manual, available at the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/" target="_blank">IRSA Spitzer
site</A>.

<a name="manydirectories"><!-- --></A><h3>Help! These things are
unzipping into separate directories!</h3>

Depending on now, exactly, you unzip your files, your computer may put
the contents of each zipfile into one directory, rather than, say, the
contents of each AOR into one directory (which was the original
design, and the conceptually most straightforward). If you are using a
GUI-based method (e.g., click to uncompress), there should be a
preferences option to allow you to uncompress subsequent zipfiles into
the same root directory.  If you use the download script above, the
flags sent on the command line that unzip the files should put all
files from the same AOR in the same directory.<P>





<h3><a name="ackn"></A>Acknowledging Spitzer and the SHA</h3>

Now that you've got your data, you're going to write a great paper.
Please add this to the acknowledgments at the end (where you can
include or drop the "in part" as your case applies):
<blockquote>
This work is based [in part] on observations made with the Spitzer
Space Telescope, obtained from the NASA/ IPAC Infrared Science
Archive, both of which are operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
