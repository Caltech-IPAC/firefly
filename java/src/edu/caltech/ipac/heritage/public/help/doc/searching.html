<A NAME="commonoptions"><!-- --></A><H3>Options Common to Most Searches</H3>

The individual search options are given below, in the same order in
which they appear in the search pane.  Most of
the search panes have the following additional options:

<DL>

<DT><a name ="aordefn"><em>Display search results in tabs for...
Observation Request (AOR), Level 2 (PBCD), Level 1 (BCD)</em>, and
sometimes <em>SSC Enhanced Products (IRS), and Contributed Enhanced
Products</em></A>

<DD>An individual Spitzer observation sequence is an <em>AOR, or
Astronomical Observation Request</em>.   Level 2 products are
higher-level products, such as mosaics. (These are also called
post-BCD, or post-Basic Calibrated Data, or PBCD, products.) Level 1
products are the individual calibrated data frames that go into
making, e.g., the mosaic (or spectrum).  (These are also called BCD,
or Basic Calibrated Data, frames.)  <em>Enhanced Products</em> come
from combining AORs or doing post processing (such as synthetic
photometry from spectra or source extraction from images). These can
be contributed by the community, or generated by the SSC itself.<P>

When you do a search, the results are displayed in tabs, and 
these tabs correspond to these options.  By default, searches return a
list of AORs under the "AOR" tab, and a list of Level 2 products under
the "Level 2 (PBCD)" tab.  You can also choose to access the original
BCD frames by selecting the "Level 1 (BCD)" option here, and then the
corresponding tab will be returned by your search. Similarly, for most
searches, you can choose "SSC Enhanced Products (IRS)", which  returns
any results in a tab called "IRS Enhanced", and/or "Contributed
Enhanced Products", which return any results in a tab called
"Contributed Products".  <P>

<b>NOTE THAT</b> each AOR produces many Level 2 (PBCD) files and many
more Level 1 (BCD) files! The number of AORs that may be returned by
any given search is going to be much smaller than the number of files
that appear on these other tabs.  You can "restrict data in other
tabs" or  apply individual <a href="results.html#filter">filters to
weed down these search results</A>.<P>

<b>IMPORTANT NOTES ON ENHANCED PRODUCTS:</b> 
<OL>
<LI>Any given search may not have any enhanced products to return --
while there are IRS observations scattered all over the sky, and while
we have had the community return back to us products from observations
all over the sky, there is much of the sky not covered by these
observations.
<LI>In order to learn more about the particular values that are
returned, how the data were reduced, its strengths and weaknesses,
etc., please see the documentation corresponding to the products. The
IRS documentation is available as part of the IRS Instrument Handbook
<a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irs/"
target="_blank">at the Spitzer IRSA website</A>; each of the
contributions in the Contributed Enhanced Products has its own
documentation at the IRSA site (linked from the search results). 
<LI>Many of the 'more options' (see below) obtainable for a position
search don't apply to enhanced products of any sort. For example, if
you ask the SHA to give you just IRAC observations at a particular
position, but also ask it to give you IRS Enhanced Products (which are
of course completely independent of any IRAC observations), it will
return just IRAC observations in the AOR/Level 1/Level 2 tabs, but the
IRS Enhanced Products search is independent of the AOR search, and may
still return viable results in that tab.
</OL>
<P>

<dt><em>More options: filter by Instrument Parameters or Wavelength
Range</em>
<dd>Spitzer has on board three instruments:
<UL>
<LI>IRAC, the Infrared Array Camera, which imaged at 3.6, 4.5,
5.8, and 8 microns.
<LI>IRS, the Infrared Spectrograph, which took spectra between 5.2
and 38 microns, and imaged in two bands centered on 16 and 22 microns.
<LI>MIPS, the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer, which imaged
at 24, 70, and 160 microns, and took spectra between 52 and 97 microns.
</UL>
By default, the SHA search pane comes up with the "<em>Instrument
Parameters</em>" radio button selected.  You can ask to have all data
from a particular instrument returned (e.g., "All IRAC").  You can
also ask to have just data from a particular observing mode returned
(e.g., just "IRS Spectral Mapping").  You can also select individual
bands, e.g., just 70 and 160 microns).  Combine various check boxes to
customize your search; go to the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/" target="_blank">Spitzer
website at IRSA</A> to learn more about instruments, observing modes,
and bandpasses. Alternatively, you can select the <em>Wavelength
Range</em> radio button and just enter the minimum and maximum
wavelength in which you are interested. Any data in that regime
(also meeting your other search criteria) will be returned by the
search.

</DL>

After you search the first time, the search pane collapses so the
results of your search can be displayed.  A summary of the most
important parameters of your search is summarized at the top. To
search again, just click on the triangle near that search summary, or
on the blue "Spitzer Searches" tab to recover the search pane.<P>



<A NAME="byPosition"><!-- --></A><H3>Position Search</H3>

This search is the most common search performed on astronomical
archives.  Enter your central position and cone (circle) radius, then
all observations (those meeting all the rest of your entered criteria)
intersecting that cone are returned.<P>

You may enter a target name, and have either NED-then-SIMBAD or
SIMBAD-then-NED resolve the target name into coordinates. 
Alternatively, you may enter coordinates directly. These coordinates
can be in decimal degrees or in hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss format.  By default,
it assumes you are working in J2000 coordinates; you can also specify
galactic, ecliptic, or B1950 coordinates as follows:
<UL>
<LI>'46.53, -0.251 gal' means 46.53, -0.251 degrees in galactic coordinates
<LI>'12.7, +4.3 ecl' means 12.7, +4.3 degrees in ecliptic coordinates
<LI>'19h17m 11d58m b1950' means 19h17m 11d58m in B1950 coordinates
</UL>
As you are completing a valid coordinate entry, the SHA echoes back to
you what it thinks you are entering. Look right below the box in which
you are typing the coordinates to see it dynamically change.
<P>

You may enter a search radius; the default is 500 arcseconds. You may
enter the radius in arcseconds, arcminutes, or degrees; just change
the pulldown option accordingly.  There are both upper and lower
limits to your search radius; the SHA will tell you if you request
something too big or too small.<P>


<A NAME="byBatch"><!-- --></A>    
The position search can also be done in "batch mode" from a list of
objects given in a file. A viable input file can either be an <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC
table file</A> or a relatively simple text file described below.  For an
IPAC table file, you may find <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblCheck/"
target="_blank">the IPAC table file verification service</A> helpful. <P>

If doing a regular non-IPAC table file search, the file format is:
<pre>
COORD_SYSTEM: Equatorial
# Equatorial, Galactic, or Ecliptic - default is Equatorial
EQUINOX: J2000
# B1950, J2000, or blank for Galactic - default is J2000
NAME-RESOLVER: NED
# NED or Simbad - default is Simbad
#Name     RA/LON       DEC/LAT     PM-RA PM-DEC EPOCH
"NGC 001" 12h34m23.45s 34d23m56.2s 2.3    3.4 1950.3
NGC2222   23.56d       34.456d     2.3    3.4 1950.3
NGC3333   23.56h       34.456d     2.3    3.4 1950.3
NGC4444  "12 34 12.23" "34 23 45.45"
m31
legacy  "17 18 00" "59 30 00"
m32
m33       simbad
NGC6946 
NGC5194 
ngc2992
</pre><P>

The SHA parses on spaces, so a space is the delimeter between fields. 
Therefore, if there is a space in your object name (e.g., "NGC 1001"
versus "NGC1001") or position ("34 23 45.45" versus 34d23m45.45s"), you
need to put quotes around the target name or its position. <p>

<em>Having problems making this work?</em> Double-check your
formatting -- that's the most common error. Check for and remove odd
non-ASCII characters like curly quotes.  If name resolution fails for
some of the targets, the rest of the search may fail -- provide
coordinates for the troublesome names, or remove them.<P>


<DL>
<DT><em>Apply spatial constraints to AORs or Individual data
products</em>

<DD>This is an additional option for the position searches. An
individual Spitzer observation sequence is an <em>AOR, or Astronomical
Observation Request</em>.  In certain cases -- often calibration or
sometimes science observations -- you may also find an IER, or
Instrument Engineering Request.  Either one involves many individual
frames.  AORs/IERs can cover large areas or, by design, multiple
targets. You can choose to return all AORs/IERs touching your search
area, or just the individual data products enclosed within your search
area e.g., just the observations that went into the portion of the sky
for which you searched.  Some products may only exist at the AOR
level, e.g., you might get the whole Level 2 mosaic for the whole AOR,
but only the Level 1 (BCD) individual data frames for the portion you
requested.  <P>

(The reason you may want the whole AOR, as opposed to just the portion
enclosed within your search radius, is that, depending on the nature
of the observation and the target, you may want the entire AOR in
order to reprocess portions of it.  For example, you may want to
remove latent instrumental effects, or  you may want to use the rest
of the AOR to assess the relative error for the region in which you
are interested -- e.g., if your dark region of interest is at the end of
some scan legs that included a bright region of sky.  Please consult
the instrument handbook for the relevant instrument in order to assess
this for your particular case.)<P> 

If you do just want to download products within a spatially confined
area, be sure you start from the Level 1 (BCD) or Level 2 (PBCD) tabs.
Downloads initiated from the AOR search results tab will download the
entire selected AOR regardless of spatial constraints.<P>

<A NAME="byAbstract"><!-- --></A><H3>Abstract Search</H3>

You can search on a string through all of the Spitzer program
abstracts. You can search on any text you would like, from principal
investigator (PI) last names to instrument names to compound terms
(such as "brown dwarf").  You can also use simple logic statements,
e.g., "star formation -galaxy" means find all instances of the terms
"star" and "formation" but not those that also use the word "galaxy." 
To enforce the appearance of a compound term, e.g., the word "star"
next to the word "formation", enclose the term in quotes.<P>

(<a href="#commonoptions">More information on options found in every search</A>.)<P>


<A NAME="byReqId"><!-- --></A><H3>AORKEY Search</H3>

An AORKEY is a large integer that uniquely identifies the observation
(AOR) within the Spitzer mission.  All Level 1 (BCD) and Level 2
(PBCD) files carry with them the fingerprints of this AORKEY (in the
filenames, in the directory structure, in the FITS headers...).
Specific AORKEYs are often listed in journal articles reporting on
Spitzer results. <P>

You can retrieve a specific observation by searching on this AORKEY. 
Note that a single AORKEY corresponds to a single AOR, so if you
search on a single AORKEY, you will always get a single AOR in the AOR
tab.<P>

You can search for many AORKEYs at once by entering a list of them
separated by commas.<P>

Some observations were obtained with some scheduling constraints,
e.g., 'observe this series of 8 AORs in this order within this time
window.'  In the AORKEY search panel, there is an option to retrieve
all the other AORs within the same scheduling constraint. <b>However,
note that</b> some time series observations were obtained in the
following mannter. For a series of observations (a, b, c, d, e), a was
tied to b with a particular constraint, b tied to c, c tied to d, and
d tied to e. If you search on the AORKEY corresponding to observation
b, and ask the SHA to give you all of the AORs constrained to that
observation, it does exactly (and only) what you asked it to do -- b
is tied to a and c, but not explicitly tied to d or e. So it returns
to you observations a, b, and c, and not d or e.  <P>  

(<a href="#commonoptions">More information on options found in every search</A>.)<P>


<A NAME="byCampId"><!-- --></A><H3>Campaign Search</H3>

In some cases, you may wish to browse all of the data taken during a
specific campaign, e.g., to investigate bright object artifacts in
your data. This feature allows you to do exactly that. A complete list
of Spitzer campaigns can be found at the <a
href="http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu" target="_blank">Spitzer
website</A>.<P>

Note that there are a few different ways to refer to a given Spitzer
campaign, and the search only recognizes two of them.  For example,
IRS campaign 47 was run between 9 Jan 2008 and 23 Jan 2008.  The
formal campaign ID (which works in the search) is IRSX008300, and the
search also works with the numerical id 1094 listed as synonymous with
this campaign on the Spitzer website. <P>

(<a href="#commonoptions">More information on options found in every search</A>.)<P>


<A NAME="byIrsEnh"><!-- --></A><H3>IRS Enhanced Products Search</H3>

The IRS Instrument Team at the SSC has generated IRS enhanced products
from low-resolution staring-mode spectra, which include a merged
spectrum (all orders), and synthetic photometry at a wide variety of
bands. There are  no IRS enhanced products for high-resolution spectra
or spectral maps. Although IRS data were obtained in a large number of
positions all over the sky, any given randomly-selected position is
not likely to have any valid IRS products, so these data are not
always available.  <P>

A specialized IRS Enhanced Products search, by default, searches the
whole sky. (This is not the case if you select the radio button asking
these products to be returned as part of another search, but it is the
case if you pick "IRS Enhanced Products" explicitly from the search
options.) You can look at all of the meta-data associated with the
catalog in a short or long form view (pulldown menu option at the top
of the pane), and the rest of the filters you can impose work just
like <a href="results.html#filter">filtering search results</A>. You
can impose multiple filters on the available parameters, and then hit
the 'search' button on the lower right to return all values meeting
your criteria. <P>

Note that a plain position search of these data is best
accomplished using an explicit "position" search, not from this "IRS
Enhanced Products" search pane.<P>

In order to learn more about the available parameters on which you can
search, the particular values that are returned, how the data were
reduced, its strengths and weaknesses, etc., please see the IRS
Instrument Handbook, available <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irs/"
target="_blank">at the Spitzer IRSA website</A>    <P>

You can control which columns are displayed, but if you download/save
the data, all of the columns are saved.<P>


<A NAME="byNaifId"><!-- --></A><H3>Moving Target Search</H3>

You can search on the name of a moving target, or the NAIF ID; moving
targets are assigned NAIF IDs, which are a unique integer identifier
for known Solar System bodies.   <P>

This search will retrieve data explicitly declared to be observations
of these moving targets in the Spitzer database.  This means, for
example, that observations of a moving target performed as a
fixed-target observation of an RA/Dec will not appear, nor will
serendipitous observations of a moving target that happens to appear
in a fixed-target observation.<P>

(<a href="#commonoptions">More information on options found in every search</A>.)<P>


<A NAME="byObsDate"><!-- --></A><H3>Observation Date Search</H3>

You can search for observations conducted between two dates.  The
dates must be specified in Universal Time (UT) and be in the format
YYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.  The maximum date range allowable is small in this
version; use large date ranges with caution because thousands of
observations can be obtained via this search.<P>

(<a href="#commonoptions">More information on options found in every search</A>.)<P>


<A NAME="byObsName"><!-- --></A><H3>Observer Name Search</H3>

You can search by name through all of the principal investigators and
technical contacts for all Spitzer programs.  Note that there is an
auto-complete on this feature, which shows you available suggestions
as you type in a string. <P>

Note also that searching on any of the instrument PIs (Fazio, Houck,
Rieke) or the Instrument Support Team leads (Reach/Carey,
Latter/Noriega-Crespo, Armus) will return <em>many</em> programs tied
to their GTO programs, or calibration programs from early in the
mission.<P>

To retrieve calibration programs during regular operations, search on
"IRS Calibration" or "IRAC Calibration" or "MIPS Calibration.<P>

(<a href="#commonoptions">More information on options found in every search</A>.)<P>



<A NAME="byProgId"><!-- --></A><H3>Program Search</H3>

All of the observations that correspond to individual observing
programs are grouped under a program identifier. This program
identifier is both a string and a number. Either the string (assigned
by the observer) or a number (assigned roughly by the order in which
the original proposal was submitted) can be used to retrieve all of
the observations that were part of that program. A complete list of
all of the Spitzer programs can be found at the <a
href="http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu" target="_blank">Spitzer
website</A>.  <P>

Note that some programs can include literally thousands of AORs,
whereas others may be just one or two AORs.  Note also that some
large science programs may be split over multiple program IDs.<P>

(<a href="#commonoptions">More information on options found in every search</A>.)<P>



<A NAME="enhanced"><!-- --></A><H3>More on Enhanced Products</H3>

<em>Enhanced Products</em> come from combining AORs or doing post
processing (such as synthetic photometry from spectra or source
extraction from images). These can be contributed by the community, or
generated by the SSC itself.<P>

The IRS Instrument Team at the SSC has generated IRS enhanced products
from low-resolution staring-mode spectra, which include a merged
spectrum (all orders), and synthetic photometry at a wide variety of
bands. There are  no IRS enhanced products for high-resolution spectra
or spectral maps.<P>

Most (but not all!) of the contributed products come from Legacy
Programs. The Legacy Programs were large, coherent science
investigations, and the teams explicitly agreed to deliver enhanced
products back to the Spitzer Science Center and IRSA. Each team
delivered something different -- some just delivered images, some
delivered images, catalogs, and spectra, some delivered
multi-wavelength resources, extending well beyond the Spitzer bands,
some delivered models. All of the products that have been ingested
into IRSA are available through this SHA interface.  Note that as
of this writing, some Legacy teams still have pending deliveries, and
that IRSA ingestion is not immediate. When a Legacy team delivers
enhanced data products to IRSA, the data must go through a quality
assurance (QA) and ingestion process before being available through
IRSA search engines, and this process does not happen instantaneously.
Also note that several Exploration Science programs expressed a desire
to deliver products back to IRSA; if this comes to pass, these
products will also be available in this fashion.
<P>

<b>NOTE THAT</b>, in order to learn more about the particular values
that are returned, how the data were reduced, its strengths and
weaknesses, etc., please see the documentation corresponding to the
products. The IRS documentation is available as part of the IRS
Instrument Handbook <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irs/"
target="_blank">at the Spitzer IRSA website</A>; each of the
contributions in the Contributed Enhanced Products has its own
documentation at the IRSA site (linked from the search results). <P>

The SHA, ultimately, can lead you back to the original AORs for the 
SSC-generated enhanced products. The community-generated ones cannot do this,
since some were generated before the 'final' processing of the BCDs.<P>

Since the contributed data products that are being served are so
different than the rest of the SHA, the way that the files are listed
is also different. Please see <a href="results.html#enhanced">the
page on search results</A> for more information.<P>
