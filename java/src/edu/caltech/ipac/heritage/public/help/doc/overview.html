<h3>Spitzer Heritage Archive: Overview</h3>

The Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA) is the final repository for all of the
data collected by Spitzer.  It is also the mechanism by which even
current users of Warm Spitzer download their data.<P>


<h3>The Spacecraft and Instruments</h3>

The Spitzer Space Telescope (formerly SIRTF, the Space Infrared
Telescope Facility), was launched into an Earth-trailing orbit on 25
August 2003. Consisting of a 0.85-meter telescope and three science
instruments, at the time of its launch, Spitzer was the largest
infrared telescope ever launched into space. The instruments aboard
Spitzer (IRAC, IRS and MIPS) obtained images and spectra at
wavelengths between 3 and 180 microns, with spatial resolution ranging
from 2 arcseconds at the shortest wavelengths to 40 arcseconds at the
longest. Spitzer is still currently taking data with IRAC at 3.6 and
4.5 during the Warm Mission Era. <a

TARGET="_blank">More information on Spitzer from the cryogenic
mission</A>, and  <a href="http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu"
TARGET="_blank">more information on Spitzer's current Warm
mission</a>, are both available.<P>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

An individual Spitzer observation sequence is an <em>AOR, or
Astronomical Observation Request</em>.  In certain cases (often
calibration or sometimes science observations), you may also see an
<em>IER, or Instrument Engineering Request</em>.  Either one involves
many individual frames.<P>

The individual data frames that emerge, calibrated, from the
Spitzer pipeline are <em>Level 1, or Basic Calibrated Data, or
BCDs</em>. <P>

The products that come from combining these individual data frames
(such as mosaics of individual pointings) are <em>Level 2, or
post-BCD, or PBCD data</em>.<P>

<em>Enhanced Products</em> come from combining AORs or doing post
processing (such as synthetic photometry from spectra or source
extraction from images). These can be contributed by the community, or
generated by the SSC itself.<P>


<h3>Searching, Results, and Filters</h3>

Several search options are provided, which are documented in more
detail <a href="searching.html">here</A>.  Searching by
position is the most popular search.  <P>

The search results appear in up to five tabs: AORs, Level 1,  Level 2,
IRS Enhanced (shorthand for "SSC-generated enhanced products for
IRS"), and Contributed Products (shorthand for "Contributed Enhanced
Products").  Each tab provides a different look at data retrieved
by your search. (See the page on <a href="results.html">understanding
your search results</A> for more information.)<P>

Filters, either imposed on your initial search or via <a
href="results.html#filter">your results page</A>, can provide a
powerful tool for weeding down search results to the observations you
want.  For example, you can restrict your search to just one
instrument or wavelength range, or you can restrict the entries in the
tabs to be just the data products pertaining to one AOR.  This same
filtering mechanism can be imposed on the entire set of IRS enhanced
products.<P>


<h3>Visualization</h3>

Powerful visualization tools were important to the original Spitzer
observation planning and archive tools (Spot and Leopard), and the
descendents of these tools are included in the SHA.  FITS
images from Spitzer or other bands (or your computer) can be loaded
into the viewer. The footprint of the observation can be overlaid on
an image of your choice.  Individual Level 1 or Level 2
products can be viewed interactively.  The coverage map (e.g., how
many times a given portion of sky was observed) can be overlaid on a
FITS image of your choice.<P>

See <a href="visualization.html">the visualization page</A> for more
on visualization.<P>

<h3>Downloading Data</h3>

After deciding what data to download, click on the corresponding
checkbox on the left side, and click "Prepare Download" to begin the
packaging and data download process -- the download then gets passed
to the Background Monitor for packaging.  See <a
href="downloads.html">the page on downloads</A> for more
information.<P>

<h3>Tagging and User Preferences</h3>

There are tools here to help you re-create a search from before (that
you or someone else did), called "<a
href="basics.html#taggging">tagging</A>," or have the SHA remember you
and your <a href="basics.html#preferences">preferences</A> when you
return.  See the <a href="user.html">user registration page</A> for
more information.<P>
