<h3>Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA) Quick Start Guide:  
<font color="red">Getting Up and Running FAST</font></h3>

<em><a href="#leopard">Jump down to section for expert Leopard users</A></em><P>

<b>Searching:</b> Many search methods are available. Most people will
probably want to search by position, which is the default option.
Target names can be automatically resolved into coordinates using NED
or SIMBAD, or you can specify coordinates (which are echoed back to
you, under the entry box, to be sure it understands you correctly). 
Cone searching is the only option at this time. You can also search by
strings through all of the abstracts (e.g., obtaining all programs
that explicitly studied planetary nebulae with Spitzer), which is a
powerful way to get started in the archive. (See the page on <a
href="searching.html">searching</A> for more information.)<P>

<b>Hints, Tips, and Term Definitions:</b> 
<UL>

<LI>An individual Spitzer observation sequence is an <em>AOR, or
Astronomical Observation Request</em>.  In certain cases (often
calibration or sometimes science observations), you may also see an
<em>IER, or Instrument Engineering Request</em>.  Either one involves
many individual frames.<P>

<LI>The individual data frames that emerge, calibrated, from the
Spitzer pipeline are <em>Level 1, or Basic Calibrated Data, or
BCDs</em>. <P>

<LI>The products that come from combining these individual data frames
(such as mosaics of individual pointings) are <em>Level 2, or
post-BCD, or PBCD data</em>.<P>

<LI>Also available are <em>Enhanced Products</em> that come from
combining AORs or doing post processing (such as synthetic photometry
from spectra or source extraction from images). These are very
powerful ways to get started on using Spitzer data in your science
pretty much straightaway. Enhanced products generated by the Spitzer
Science Center (SSC) are returned in a tab separately from the
substantial contributed enhanced products that were delivered by the
community to the SSC and IRSA (and continue to be delivered to IRSA);
these contributed enhanced products can include mosaics, photometry,
spectra, and data from telescopes other than Spitzer. (See this page
on <a href="searching.html#enhanced">searching enhanced products</A>
for more information.)<P>

<LI>Spitzer observations can cover large areas or, by design, multiple
targets. If you are interested in just portions of the larger
observation, you can choose to have just <em>individual data
products</em> returned -- e.g., just the observations that went into
the portion of the sky for which you searched -- or you can return the
products for the whole AOR.<P>

<LI>You can search for observations by instrument or by wavelength.
<UL>
<LI><em>IRAC, the Infrared Array Camera</em> imaged at 3.6, 4.5,
5.8, and 8 microns.
<LI><em>IRS, the Infrared Spectrograph</em> took spectra between 5.2
and 38 microns, and imaged in two bands centered on 16 and 22 microns.
<LI><em>MIPS, the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer</em> imaged
at 24, 70, and 160 microns, and took spectra between 52 and 97 microns.

<b>Search Results:</b> The search results appear in up to five tabs:
AORs, Level 1, Level 2, IRS Enhanced, and Contributed Products.  Each
tab provides a different look at the data retrieved by your search.
(See the page on <a href="results.html">understanding your search
results</A> for more information.)<P>

<b>Filtering:</b> Filters, either imposed on your initial search or
via <a href="results.html#filter">your results page</A>, can provide a
powerful tool for weeding down search results to the observations you
want.<P>

<b>Visualizing:</b>  <a href="visualization.html">Visualization</A> is
a powerful tool for understanding exactly what each observation did
and deciding what data to download.<P>

<b>Downloading Data:</b> Click on the checkboxes and then click
"Prepare Download" to begin packaging your data for download in the
background. See <a href="basics.html#download">the page on the
downloading</A> for more information.<P>

<b>Program Interface:</b> You can also access the SHA from the  <a
href="api.html">command line</A>.<P>

For more help, definitions, etc., see the more detailed online help on
the left, or the PDF SHA manual, available on the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/" target="_blank">IRSA Spitzer
website</A>, or the <a href="http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">site for

<h3><a name="leopard"><!-- --></A>Quick Start for Expert Leopard
Users</h3>

The SHA does in fact do everything Leopard did, just differently. Some
things it does much better, and there are lots more features as well.
Here is a quick-start guide for Leopard experts.<P>

The SHA returns your search results in up to five tabs -- one for AORs
(the most compact view of the observations, and the one most like
Leopard), one for post-BCDs, one for BCDs, one for IRS Enhanced
Products (meaning developed here at the SSC), and one for Contributed
Enhanced Products (currently meaning [mostly] Legacy Enhanced
Products) results. Not all of these are returned by default -- or even
exist -- for every search; you will need to enable some of these tabs
based on the search parameters. (<a href="searching.html">More
information on searching</A>.)

To the right of the search results window pane is a details pane,
which is also where you can investigate coverage, individual data
frames (real data, not jpegs like Leopard), and play with
visualization (like Leopard's visualization features). You can also
download catalogs into this window.  (<a
href="visualization.html">More information on visualization</A>.)

<DL>
<dt><em>If you have proprietary data you're trying to retrieve...</em>
<dd>...log in first. Click on "sign in" in the upper right of the
window. If you don't yet have an account, set one up and email the Spitzer
Helpdesk (help-at-spitzer.caltech.edu) your account name and program
number, and ask for that account to be tied to that program. (<a
href="user.html">More information on user accounts</A>.)<P>

<dt><em>Finding all data by program number</em>
<dd>Search by program and enter the program number.  (<a
href="searching.html">More information on searching</A>.) Continue with
"Downloading data" below.<P>

<dt><em>Finding data by PI</em>
<dd>Search by Observer and enter the name you want. You need to enter your
whole name, and when you start typing characters in the box, a
dropdown will appear with the viable choices.  
<em>Have many programs?</em> Add a filter -- Click on
"add filters"  in the upper right of the "Campaign Search Results"
pane. Click on "Program ID" from the first drop-down menu. Leave the
operator as the default "=". Enter the program ID you want. Apply the
filter and close the filters window. Just the AORs from that program
will appear. (<a href="searching.html">More information on
searching</A>.) Once you find the data you want, continue with
"Downloading data" below.<P>

<dt><em>Finding your data by campaign</em>
<dd>Many programs in the Warm Era are time series observations, and
some investigators may want all the data from a given program that
have just been released. To do this: Search by campaign for the most
recent campaign. Many AORs will be returned.  Once the results appear,
apply a filter to the results. Click on "add filters"  in the upper
right of the "Campaign Search Results" pane. Click on "Program ID"
from the first drop-down menu. Leave the operator as the default "=".
Enter the program ID you want. Apply the filter and close the filters
window. Just the AORs from that campaign and that program will appear.
(<a href="searching.html">More information on searching</A>.) Continue
with "Downloading data" below. <P>

<dt><em>Downloading <b>all</b> data shown</em>
<dd>Once the search results are returned (and filtered if applicable),
click on the checkbox at the upper left of the Search Results window
pane, and the individual checkboxes in each row will automatically all
be checked. Then click on "Prepare Download" (immediately above the
column of checkboxes).  Choose which types of data you wish to
download. All the data will be zipped up within the Background
Monitor.  If you have many zipfiles to download, a download (wget)
script is also provided, which can enable automatic downloads of all
the zipfiles. (<a href="downloads.html">More information on
downloading data</A>.)<P>

<dt><em>Downloading <b>just some</b> of the data shown</em> <dd>Click
on the checkbox on the far left of the data you want downloaded. You
can do this in any of the tabs that are returned.  Then click on
"Prepare Download" (immediately above the column of checkboxes). 
Choose which types of data you wish to download. All the data will be
zipped up within the Background Monitor.  If you have many zipfiles to
download, a wget script is also provided, which can enable automatic
downloads of all the zipfiles. (<a href="downloads.html">More
information on downloading data</A>.)<P>

<dt><em>Where is this particular file I've come to know and love?</em> 
<dd>Be sure that you have clicked "include ancillary data" when you
package up the data. Almost certainly the file(s) you seek are tagged
as secondary (ancillary) files; just packaging up the plain Level 1/2
files will just get you the primary products.  Beginning users are
more likely to just want the primary products, whereas you, an expert
user, may indeed want the secondary products too.<P>

<dt><em>Where is Leopard's Popular Products search?</em>  
<dd>This is now folded into the "enhanced products" searches,
available from the position search, or (for the IRS enhanced products)
in a search exclusive to that product.  You can choose to have those
results returned from the main position search pane. The "Contributed
enhanced product" results include a summary tab of all of the
contributed enhanced products that IRSA has ingested that meet your
search criteria. The IRS enhanced products search offers several
options specific to that data. (<a href="searching.html#enhanced">More
information on searching enhanced products generally</A>, and <a
href="searching.html#byIrsEnh">more information on an IRS Enhanced
Product search</A> in particular.)<P>
