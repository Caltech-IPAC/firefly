<h3>Understanding Your Search Results from the Image Service</h3>


This page provides an overview of the information that is returned during an 
Image Service search.

<A NAME="terminology"><!-- --></A><H3>Terminology</H3>

The service provides an interface to access images from LCOGT image metadata.
Following a search, you will see a results page consisting of three main panes: the results pane, 
the coverage and the image display.


<A NAME="commonoptions"><!-- --></A><H3>Common Options</H3>

<dl>
<dt><em>Downloading Data</em>
<dd>In order to download the images, click 
on the checkbox to the left of
the entry you want to download, and then click on the "Prepare
Download" button at the top of the column.  The <a
href="basics.html#download">Background Monitor</A> is then launched to
prepare your data for download. When your packaged data are ready,
save your data to disk. <P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. <P>

<dt><em>Coverage </em>
<dd> 
For a single target positional search, the coverage 
tab in the coverage pane displays the footprint
of the resulting images which contain the search target overlaid on another image.
Only the images displayed in the current page are overlayed in the coverage tab.
You can change the page size or add filters to the results to get different set
of images overlaid.

<P>

<dt><em>Saving the results</em>
<dd>The search results can be saved to a
text file by clicking the "Save" button or viewed as a text file by
clicking the "as Text" button.<P>

<dt><em>Filtering</em>
<dd>Filters can be added interactively -- see <a
href="#filter">Filtering</A> below for more information.<P>

<dt><a name="newcolumns"><em>Adding/removing columns</em></A>
<dd>Several columns of information on each data set are automatically displayed 
in each of these tabs by default. Additional columns 
can be added/removed by clicking on the "Edit Table Options" Icon (small grid on the far upper
right corner of the results pane <img src="table_options.gif">). 
The results can be sorted by clicking on any column's name.
<P>

<dt><em>Changing the number of rows</em>
<dd>By default, 50 rows are returned
per page; more or fewer rows can be displayed by changing the Page Size number
in the "Edit Table Options" menu <img src="table_options.gif">, or by changing the Table Page Size entry in 
the Preferences tab. You can scroll through search results pages by the
arrows in the middle of the results table tab header. 
Do you have too many rows?  Further
restrict the search by imposing additional <a
href="#filter">filtering</A>; see below!<P>

<dt><em>Changing the size of the window or columns</em>
<dd>You can click and drag to resize the window pane or individual
columns.<P>

<dt><em>View Options</em>
<dd>You can chose between "Table View" and "Grid View" (icons in the top right corner of the results page) 
to display the search results. "Table View" lists the available observations in table format in the results 
pane and only 
displays the images associated with the currently selected image set (highlighted in green in the results pane 
table). Alternatively, "Grid View" simply displays all of the images of the search results. Note that the 
artifact overlay (accessed via the "Plot Layers" tab) is not available in "Grid View".  
<P>

</dl>

<A NAME="results"><!-- --></A><H3>Position Search Results</H3>

After a positional <a href="searching.html">search</A>, the results
pane in the browser  window will contain
a table with one row for each of the images which fulfills your search criteria.

Columns provide basic image information
Once a positional search is completed and images are displayed,
a Catalog Search can be performed to indicate the presence of
catalog sources within the images.
The visualization seen in the
the image display pane will change depending on which source is selected.
The selected source is highlighted in green in the table of
search results. When overlaying the source detections of a catalog search, note that only the sources of the
current results page are displayed. Select another page or increase the page size to see additional
source overlays.  <P>

<em>Column Headings</em>: The columns displayed in the search results
tables can be modified. Click on the "Edit Table Options" icon <img src="table_options.gif"> in the top right corner
of the results pane to change the columns shown.
 <P>

<em>Sorting Columns </em>: The columns displayed in the search results can be sorted by
 clicking on the column headers.
 <P>

Do you have too many rows?  Further restrict the search by imposing
additional <a href="#filter">filtering</A>; see below!<P>


<A NAME="visualization"><!-- --></A><H3>Visualization</H3>

Following the positional search, the images of the selected 
entry in the search results table will be displayed in the lower portion 
of the browser window.  The entry position highlighted in green 
is centered in each wavelength image field of view and target positions are indicated with a blue circle 
overlay on the image. Note that there is a
factor of two resolution change between 3.4 and 22 microns. <P>
Please refer to the help section on <a href="visualization.html">visualization</a> for more information. 

<A NAME="filter"><!-- --></A><H3>Filtering -- Imposing additional
filters to get the most out of your search results</H3>

Even if your search returned only one source, you could have literally
hundreds of columns that appear in the source catalogs. 
In order to quickly weed through which information 
appears in the tab and examine the source you care about,
<em>filters</em> are a very powerful tool. <P>

Click on "Add filters" in order to add a new filter. Each of your
current columns can be selected in a pulldown menu, as well as an
operation (=, <, etc).  If you select a field with a limited set of
choices, an additional pulldown appears with those limited choices.<P>


You can add additional filters to further restrict your list of
sources.<P>
