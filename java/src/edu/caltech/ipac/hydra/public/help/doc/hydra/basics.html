<A NAME="searching"><!-- --></A><H3>Searches -- The basics of searching</H3>

Searching the image archive is straightforward, and a wide variety of
options can be obtained by clicking on the "Search" menu option.  The
position search is the most commonly used search option.  Users may enter target names,
which will be automatically resolved into coordinates using NED or SIMBAD, or
enter coordinates directly. A Multi-Object search option using a user-supplied input table
is also available. Users need to specify whether to search the Preliminary or All-Sky data 
release and select the desired Data Product Level (single exposure images, coadded atlas images, or both). 
There are many more search options, described in detail <a
href="searching.html">on the page on searching</A>.<P>

You may wish to impose additional filters on your search results; see
<a href="results.html#filter">this page</A> for more information on
filtering.<P>

A search will return a list of images selected by the
input parameters, together with preview images.
In the lower portion of the search results window, images 
will appear after a positional search.  See the page on  <a
href="visualization.html">visualization</A> for more information on
the options within the visualization tabs.<P> 


<A NAME="searchHistory"><!-- --></A><H3>History -- Your search history</H3>

The History tab menu option gives you access to your own search
history.  
All of the searches that you perform during a given session with the archive
are remembered in the search history panel. A high-level summary of
the search is also listed -- what kind of search you performed and which
parameters you used.<P>

You can resubmit the search (see buttons at top left of the search
history window), remove the search from your history, or save the search
as a favorite search to which you can return at a later time/date. 
<P>

<A NAME="catalogs"><!-- --></A><H3>Catalogs -- Retrieving and using catalogs</H3>

You can choose to overlay sources from a wide variety of catalogs on your <a
href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. Click on the 
"Catalogs" tab and a pop-up window several options will appear. 
<P>

The default search method is set to "polygon" where the four corners of the 
image selected on the search result page are used as the default input coordinates. 
Various other search methods (cone, elliptical, box, multi-object, all sky) are 
also available. For example,  
the "cone" search method will default to the target name or position of your currently 
selected search result.  
If you would like to change the center of the
search for purposes of the catalog search, click on "modify target"
and enter the new information.  
<P>

You can choose catalogs based first on the "Project" under which
they are housed at IRSA, e.g. 2MASS, IRAS, Spitzer (delivered Legacy
catalogs), MSX, COSMOS, DENIS, USNO, etc.  The options listed under
"Category" and the specific clickable catalog then change according to the
project you select.  A short description is provided for each of the catalogs.<P>

Click on "Search" to initiate the search. <b>NOTE THAT</b> the search
may take a long time. Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Once you hit search, you are returned to the search results page.
For small search radii (when the search is not run in the background), the catalog search results will 
automatically appear in a new tab next to your image search results. Note that there could be a small delay 
between clicking "search" and the appearance of the new catalog tab. For a large search,  
the gear wheel image <img src="One_gear-32x32-single.png"> should appear 
in the background monitor (on the top right) after a short delay  
to indicate that the search is in 
progress. Once the search is complete, open the background monitor and click on "show catalog" and your
catalog search results will be displayed in a new tab next to your image search results. Depending on the 
size of the results of your catalog search, there can be a delay between clicking on "show catalog" and the 
appearance of the results tab.  You
can also save the catalog to your local disk for future use.
<P>


<A NAME="download"><!-- --></A><H3>Background Monitor -- Downloading
data and catalogs in the background</H3>

<DL>
<DT><em>Downloading data</em><P>

<DD>After deciding which data to download, click the checkboxes to pick
specific data files to download, and then click "Prepare Download" to
begin the  packaging and downloading process.  A pop-up window will
appear in order to define exactly what kinds of data you would like to
have packaged up. Clicking "Prepare Download" initializes this process.<P>

After you click "Prepare Download", the Background Monitor appears in the 
top right corner of your
window to keep track of the data download.  This panel can be called
up by simply clicking on it.  You can watch
your data being packaged, and when the data are available for
download, it will update that panel, providing a link for downloading
the packaged data. Your most recent download request appears on the top of the list. <P>

<strong>Important note</strong>: don't log in while it is preparing a
download! If you log in during a download, as far as the system is
concerned, you have changed identities (from 'anonymous' to 'jones',
say), and as a result it does not complete preparing the download.<P>

<dt><em>Downloading catalogs</em><P>
<dd>The Background Monitor will also
keep track of catalog downloads for you. <P>
</DL><P>


<A NAME="preferences"><!-- --></A><H3>Preferences -- Setting and using your preferences</H3>

The preferences menu option provides a few ways to customize your
experience.  The pop-up window that appears when you click that option
gives you by default a choice of the number of entries that appear in
the table by default, and allows you to enter your email for an email
notification when data are packaged. You can also pick the units (degrees or arcminutes) for the 
readout of the Distance Measurement Tool. <P>
