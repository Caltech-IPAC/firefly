The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) was a 40 cm space telescope 
cooled to cryogenic temperatures by solid hydrogen which observed the entire 
sky in 2010 at wavelengths of 3.3, 4.5, 12, and 22 microns. WISE performed 
its all-sky
survey uniformly with a single observing strategy, namely scan mapping
approximately along meridians of constant ecliptic longitude. In scan 
mapping, the telescope
slews continuously across the sky while image motion compensation is performed
by an internal cryogenic scan mirror.  Single 9.9 second images covering
a region of 47 arcmin on a side were obtained simultaneously in all four 
bands by using dichroics. Consecutive images overlap by about 10% in the 
scan direction. At the ecliptic plane, WISE fields of view are typically 
observed about ten times, with 90% overlap in the cross-scan direction between
consecutive visits. The number of overlapping images, or "coverage", varies
widely in the WISE survey, from just a few frames in regions heavily impacted 
by the moon in the ecliptic plane to many hundreds near the ecliptic pole.
More information on WISE can be found in Wright et al. (2010) PASP.
The WISE preliminary data release consists of a set of individual frames, 
coadded images, and source catalogs covering 57% of the sky. The WISE
final data release in 2012 will contain reprocessed images and source
catalogs covering the full sky. WISE images are obtained through the
NWIS, while WISE catalog data are accessible through the IRSA GATOR tool

<A NAME="searching"><!-- --></A><H3>Searches -- The basics of searching</H3>

xxx Replace with PTF
Searching the archive is straightforward, and a wide variety of
options can be obtained by clicking on the "Search" menu option.  The
position search is the most commonly-used search option.  Target names
can be automatically resolved into coordinates using NED or SIMBAD, or
you can specify coordinates, and you specify the search radius.  There
are many more search options, described in detail <a
href="searching.html">on the page on searching</A>.<P>

WISE observations cover the entire sky, although the preliminary
release only covers 57% of the sky. You may request 
single wavelength individual frames and coadded images of a region 
within a target area.  (See the page on <a
href="results.html">understanding your search results</A> for more
information.)<P>

You may wish to impose additional filters on your search results; see
<a href="results.html#filter">this page</A> for more information on
filtering.<P>

A search will return the a list of images selected by the
input parameters, together with preview images.
In the lower portion of the NWIS window, images of WISE sources
will appear after a positional search. Data from all four of 
the WISE bands (FITS) will be depicted. See the page on  <a
href="visualization.html">visualization</A> for more information on
the options within the visualization tabs.<P> 


<A NAME="searchHistory"><!-- --></A><H3>History/Tags -- Your search history and tag history</H3>

The History/Tags menu option gives you access to your own search
history and tag history.  By default, it comes up with the Search
History tab in the foreground; to access the Tag History, just
click on the "Tag" tab.<P>

<DL>
<DT><em>Your Search History</em><P>

<DD>All of the searches that you do for a given session with the archive
are remembered in the search history panel. A high-level summary of
the search is also listed -- what kind of search it was and what
parameters you used.<P>

You can resubmit the search (see buttons at top left of the search
history tab), remove the search from your history, or save the search
as a favorite search to which you can return at a later time/date. 
<P>

<DT><em>Tags and Your Tagging History</em><P>

xxx Replace with PTF

<DD>Many of the papers published on WISE data include a
list of all the individual source names used for data discussed 
in that paper.  This
provides an easy way for readers to retrieve the data from the WISE
archive, and links can be made from ADS directly back to the NWIS.<P>

However, many papers use many sources.  Data tagging allows you to
customize the data set you use so that the link back from ADS (or
embedded in your paper itself) refers to a single unique identifier
that corresponds to all your data. (That is, a single identifier, as
opposed to a potentially long list of sources.)<P>

Once you have established a search that you like, you can click on the
"Tag It" icon in the top right of the search results tabs. It will then ask
for a nickname, and then return the tag name for insertion into your
paper as well as a direct URL you can distribute. <P>

Once you have tagged a search, it appears in the "Tags" tab.
If you tag when logged in to the NWIS, the tags will be remembered 
during your next session.<P>

</DL>

<A NAME="catalogs"><!-- --></A><H3>Catalogs -- Retrieving and using catalogs</H3>

You can choose from any of a wide variety of catalogs to load in
preparation for overlaying on your <a
href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. By clicking on the
"Catalog" menu option, a pop-up window appears with several options, as
follows. <P>

The target name is by default the one for the current search with
which you are working. If you would like to change the center of the
search for purposes of the catalog search, click on "modify target"
and enter the new information.  All of the same parameters as for a
position search of the NWIS appear.<P>

You can then choose catalogs based first on the "project" under which
they are housed at IRSA: 2MASS, IRAS, Spitzer (delivered Legacy
catalogs), MSX, COSMOS, DENIS, USNO, or BOLOCAM.  The options under the
"category" and the specific clickable catalog change according to the
project.  A short description is provided for each of the catalogs.<P>

Click on "Search" to initiate the search.<b>NOTE THAT</b> the search
may take a long time to return, and you may think that nothing has
happened, but be patient and eventually it will return a tab.<P>

Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Searches that retrieve more rows
will take even longer.<P>

If the catalog search is successful, it will return the results in a
tab of its own, in an interface similar to the other data tabs. You
can save the catalog to your local disk for future use. <P> 




<A NAME="download"><!-- --></A><H3>Background Monitor -- Downloading
data and catalogs in the background</H3>

<DL>
<DT><em>Downloading data</em><P>

<DD>After deciding what data to download, click the checkboxes to pick
specific data files to download, and then click "Prepare Download" to
begin the  packaging and downloading process.  A pop-up window will
appear in order to define exactly what kinds of data you would like to
have packaged up. Clicking OK initializes this process.<P>

After you click ok, the Background Monitor appears as a panel in your
window to keep track of the data download.  This panel can be called
up by selecting the "Background Monitor" menu option.  You can watch
your data being packaged, and when the data are available for
download, it will update that panel, providing a link for downloading
the packaged data.<P>

<strong>Important note</strong>: don't log in while it is preparing a
download! If you log in during a download, as far as the system is
concerned, you have changed identities (from 'anonymous' to 'jones',
say), and as a result it does not complete preparing the download.<P>

<dt><em>Downloading catalogs</em><P>
<dd>In a future version of the NWIS, the Background Monitor will also
keep track of catalog downloads for you. <P>
</DL><P>


<A NAME="preferences"><!-- --></A><H3>Preferences -- Setting and using your preferences</H3>

The preferences menu option provides a few ways to customize your
experience.  The pop-up window that appears when you click that option
gives you by default a choice of the number of entries that appear in
the table by default, and allows you to enter your email for an email
notification when data are packaged.<P>
