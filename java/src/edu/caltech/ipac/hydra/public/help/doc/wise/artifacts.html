<h3>Artifact Overlays on WISE Images</h3>

The "Plot Layers" tab enables the user
to mark sources in the selected WISE images which are potentially affected
by image artifacts (only in the table format view option). The available artifact flags are diffraction
spikes (orange dot), scattered light halos (yellow squares), optical
ghosts (pink diamonds), and latent images (green "x"s). The artifact
flagging is based on geometric positions of detected sources relative
to bright objects. Sources thus flagged may be spurious detections
on the image artifacts or real astronomical sources potentially 
contaminated by the artifact. Spurious detections are indicated
by a capital letter in the cc_flags column of the Gator source
output, and contaminated real sources are indicated by a lower
case letter. For more information on artifact identification
(ARTID) consult

Explanatory Supplement to the WISE Preliminary Data Release Products</a>.
<p>
If the WISE pipeline did not detect
a source, the region will not be flagged, regardless of whether an
artifact visibly occurs in that part of the image. On the other hand,
bright nebulosity or satellite trails can trigger diffraction 
artifact detection although no diffraction spikes or halos actually
appear in the image. In addition, flagged sources may be excluded
from the WISE Catalogs. We have tried to err 
on the side of overflagging potentially unaffected sources in the Preliminary 
Data Release.  When in doubt, always check the images. A more
sophisticated version of artifact flagging was employed in the All-Sky 
Data Release. <P>
