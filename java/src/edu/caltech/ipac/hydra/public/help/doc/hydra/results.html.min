<h3>Understanding Your Search Results from the NASA WISE Image Server</h3>


This page is an overview of what exactly is returned by a NASA WISE
Image Server (NWIS) search. After terminology and a general
description of some common options, including how to download data,
the individual tabs are discussed, and then we discuss how to further
refine the search results by imposing filters.<P>

<A NAME="terminology"><!-- --></A><H3>Terminology</H3>

This is the NASA WISE Image Server (NWIS).<P>

The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) conducted an all-sky 
survey at four wavelength bands between 3.3 and 22 microns.
These bands are W1 (3.3 microns), W2 (4.5 microns), W3 (12 microns),
and W4 (22 microns).  The NWIS serves as an interface to access images 
in each wavelength band and determine which WISE catalog
sources are within these images. NWIS positional
search results appear in up to an arbitraty number of tabs: 
the Level 1b WISE individual frame image table, the Level 3 
WISE coadded image table, and tables from catalog searches within these
images.  Each tab provides a different look at 
the data retrieved by your search. 
(See the page on <a href="results.html">understanding
your search results</A> for more information.)<P>

There are two multiband source lists which are included
with the WISE Preliminary Data Release. These are the WISE Preliminary 
Release Source Catalog (WPRSC) and the WISE Single-exposure Source
Database (WSSD).<P>

<A NAME="commonoptions"><!-- --></A><H3>Common Options</H3>

<dl>
<dt><em>Downloading Data</em>
<dd>In order to download the WISE images, click 
on the checkbox to the left of
the entry you want to download, and then click on the "Prepare
Download" button at the top of the column.  The <a
href="basics.html#download">Background Monitor</A> is then launched to
prepare your data for download. When your packaged data are ready,
save your data to disk. <P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. <P>

<dt><em>Saving the results</em>
<dd>The search results can be saved to a
text file by clicking the "Save" button or viewed as a text file by
clicking the "Text View" button.<P>

<dt><em>Filtering</em>
<dd>Filters can be added interactively -- see <a
href="#filter">Filtering</A> below for more information.<P>

<dt><a name="newcolumns"><em>Adding/removing columns</em></A>
<dd>Several columns come up in each of these tabs by default, and they
can be added/removed by clicking on the small grid on the far upper
right of the corresponding tab's columns (<img src="addcols.gif">). 
The results can be sorted by clicking on any column's name.<P>

<dt><em>Changing the number of rows</em>
<dd>By default, 50 rows are returned
per page; more or fewer rows can be displayed by changing the number
in the bottom center of the pane. You can scroll through pages by the
arrows on the bottom left and see how many rows there are total via
the count on the bottom right.  Do you have too many rows?  Further
restrict the search by imposing additional <a
href="#filter">filtering</A>; see below!<P>

<dt><em>Changing the size of the window or columns</em>
<dd>You can click and drag to resize the window pane or individual
columns.<P>

</dl>

<A NAME="Details"><!-- --></A><H3>Details</H3>

After a positional <a href="searching.html">search</A>, the "Details" 
pane of your NWIS window will contain
one or more tabs depending on the image data requested: Level 1b (single
WISE frame images) and/or Level 3 (coadded images). Clicking on
the tab reveals a table with one row for each of the images selected
in the search. Columns provide basic image information, such as 
band, frame/scan/coadd identification, magnitude of zero flux, 
number of frames (coadd only), time since anneal (dtanneal), etc.
Once a positional search is completed and images are displayed,
a Catalog Search can be performed to indicate the presence of
catalog sources within the images. 
The visualization seen in the lower portion of
the NWIS window will change depending on which source is selected.
The selected sources are highlighted in green in the table of
search results.<P>

<em>Column Headings</em>: The columns displayed in the search results
tables can be modified. Click on the table icon in the right top corner
of the "Details" pane to change the columns shown. 
See <a href="columns.html">Columns</A> for details on column interpretation. <P>

Do you have too many rows?  Further restrict the search by imposing
additional <a href="#filter">filtering</A>; see below!<P>

(<a href="#commonoptions">More information on options found in every tab</A>.)<P>

<A NAME="Visualization"><!-- --></A><H3></H3>

Following the positional search, the WISE four band images of the selected 
entry in search results table will be displayed in the lower portion 
of the NWIS window.  The entry position highlighted in blue 
is centered in each wavelength image field of view. Note that there is a
factor of two resolution change between 3.3 and 22 microns. <P>


<A NAME="filter"><!-- --></A><H3>Filtering -- Imposing additional
filters to get the most out of your search results</H3>

Even if your search returned only one source, you could have literally
hundreds of columns that appear in the source catalogs. 
In order to quickly weed through what information 
appears in the tab and examine the source you care about,
<em>filters</em> are a very powerful tool. <P>

Click on "Add filters" in order to add a new filter. Each of your
current columns can be selected in a pulldown menu, as well as an
operation (=, <, etc).  If you select a field with a limited set of
choices, an additional pulldown appears with those limited choices.<P>

For example, if you have searched on a position and would like to
only view the WISE coadds with more than 10 repeat frames select
'numfrms', '>' from the relevant pulldowns, enter '100' (=10.0) in 
the text box, then
"ADD" the filter and "APPLY" it to your search results. Then, the
number of sources is limited, and the notice on the top right of the
search results pane reminds you that there has been a filter applied.
Filtering only affects the values in the columns for the current
tab selected. <P>

You can add additional filters to further restrict your list of
sources.<P>
