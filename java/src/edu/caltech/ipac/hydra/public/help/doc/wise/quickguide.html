<b>Searching:</b> Many search methods are available. Most people will
probably want to search by position, which is the default option.
Target names can be automatically resolved into coordinates using NED
or SIMBAD, or you can specify coordinates.  
See the page on <a
href="searching.html">searching</A> for more information.<P>

<b>Hints, Tips, and Term Definitions:</b> 
<UL>

<LI><b> Source Catalog Queries:</b> In addition to searching for WISE images, various WISE multiband 
source lists are also available for queries. 
Catalog
queries are most easily performed using the separate IRSA catalog search tool. 
However, as part of the image service, WISE
catalog sources within previously displayed WISE images may be retrieved using 
the Catalogs tab on the top toolbar. Please consult the page on <a href="basics.html#catalogs">
Catalogs </a> for more information. <P>

<LI><b>Search Results:</b> The search results appear in up to several tabs:
Single Exposure (Level 1b), Atlas (Level 3), and a variety of potential catalog searches.  
Each tab provides a different look at the
data retrieved by your search. See the page on <a
href="results.html">understanding your search results</A> for more
information.<P>

<LI><b>Filtering:</b> Filters, either imposed on your initial search or
via <a href="results.html#filter">your results page</A>, can provide a
powerful tool for narrowing down the search results to the observations you
want.<P>

<LI><b>Visualizing:</b>  <a href="visualization.html">Visualization</A> is
a powerful tool for understanding how your object of interest was observed by WISE
and deciding which data to download.<P>

<LI><b>Downloading Data:</b> You can select specific datasets by clicking on their respective checkboxes, then click
"Prepare Download" to begin packaging your data for download in the
background. See the page on the <a href="basics.html#download">
Background Monitor</A> for more information.<P>
