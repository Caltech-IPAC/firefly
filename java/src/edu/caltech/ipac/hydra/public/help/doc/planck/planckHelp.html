<h3>NASA Planck Archive Quick Start Guide:  
<font color="red">Getting Up and Running FAST</font></h3>


<b>Searching:</b> The default search (and most common) is 
by position.  Target names can be automatically resolved into 
coordinates using NED or SIMBAD, or you can specify the coordinates directly.  
See the page on <a href="#searches">searching</A> for more information.<P>

<b>Hints, Tips, and Term Definitions:</b> 
<UL>

<LI> The Planck sources which can currently be searched using the NASA
Planck Archive (NPA) web interface are from the Planck Early Release
Compact Source Catalog (ERCSC).

<LI>
There are two source catalogs based on multifrequency detection algorithms
which are included with the Planck early data release.  These are the Early
Release SZ Cluster catalog (ESZ) and the Early Release Galactic Cold Cores
catalog (ECC). <P>

<LI>Planck observations cover the whole sky, so all-sky catalogs
are available for each of the 9 frequency ranges covered by Planck. 
These have not been merged into a single multi-wavelength catalog. 
If you are interested in individual sources, you can 
search for that source in all of the Planck early release catalogs
at once. WMAP and IRAS images are also provided for individual
sources.<P>
</UL>

<b>Search Results:</b> The search results appear in up to eleven tabs:
one each for the nine Planck bands from
30-857 GHz, one for the ESZ catalog, and one for the ECC catalog.
(See the page on <a
href="#results">understanding your search results</A> for more
information.)<P>

<b>Filtering:</b> Filters, either imposed on your initial search or
via <a href="#filter">your results page</A>, can provide a
powerful tool for narrowing down search results to the observations you
want.<P>

<b>Visualizing:</b>  <a href="#visualization">Visualization</A> is
a powerful tool for deciding what data to download.<P>

<b>Downloading Data:</b> Click on the checkboxes and then click
"Prepare Download" to begin packaging your data for download in the
background. See <a href="#download">the page on the
Background Monitor</A> for more information.<P>

 <A NAME="overview"><!-- --></A>
<h3>NASA Planck Archive: Overview</h3>

The NASA Planck Archive (NPA) is the final United States repository for 
all of the
data collected by the joint European Space Agency/NASA Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation mission, Planck.  Only Planck data that have been
released to the public are available via this interface.  <P>


<h3>The Spacecraft and Instruments</h3>

The Planck Telescope, consisting of a 1.5-meter telescope and two science
instruments, was launched into an L2 orbit on May 14, 2009. 
Planck has performed a  
detailed study of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The 
instruments aboard Planck --- the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) 
and High Frequency Instrument (HFI) --- obtained images at
wavelengths between 30 and 857 GHz, with spatial resolution ranging
from 5 arcminutes at the shortest wavelengths to 33 arcminutes at the
longest. More information on Planck can be found at
<a href="http://planck.caltech.edu/index.html"
target="_blank">http://planck.caltech.edu/index.html</A>.

<h3>Planck Mission</h3>

The primary source of Planck data accessible by the NPA web
tool is the Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalog (ERCSC).
In addition, there are
two catalogs based on multifrequency detection algorithms
which are included
with the Planck early data release. These are the Early Release
SZ (Sunyaev-Zel'dovich) Cluster catalog (ESZ) and the Early Release Galactic 
Cold Cores catalog (ECC).<P>

<h3>Searching, Results, and Filters</h3>

The NASA Planck Archive provides several options for searching its holdings.
These are documented in more detail <a href="#searching">here</A>.  
Most people using the archive will use the Position search, which allows you to
enter a location in celestial coordinates or by object name.
<P>

The search results are displayed on the screen using a maximum of 11 tabs --- 
one each for the nine Planck bands from
30-857 GHz, one for the ESZ catalog, and one for the ECC catalog.
(See the page on <a href="#results">understanding
your search results</A> for more information.)<P>

Filters, either imposed on your initial search or via <a
href="#filter">your results page</A>, can provide a
powerful tool for narrowing search results to the observations you
want.  For example, you can restrict your search based on source flux density
or morphology, or you can restrict the entries in the tabs to be just
those objects observed more than, say, three times.<P>


<h3>Visualization</h3>

Once you've selected the objects using the selection and filtering
tools, the NPA will display JPEG images of a small area around each object.
These will be shown below the search results table, with the catalog
entry highlighted in green and the object centered in the field of view 
for each wavelength. There is a factor of 7 change in the resolution between
the 30 GHz and 857 GHz data, so there will be different-sized images
for each wavelength. The size of the image is set to 4 times the beam 
full width half maximum for each wavelength. 
WMAP and IRAS images, where available, are also shown for each table entry.
See <a href="#visualization">the visualization page</A> for more
information.<P>

<h3>Downloading Data</h3>

If you'd like to download the data for use in other programs or for 
further study, click on the checkbox on the left side of the 
search results subwindow which corresponds
to the data of interest. Next, click "Prepare Download" to begin the 
packaging and data download process. The data
will be made into a downloadable package by a background job,
which will notify you via email when it's finished. 
See <a
href="#download">the page on the Background Monitor</A> for
more information.<P>

<h3>User Preferences</h3>

"Tagging" is a tool that allows you to name a search and recreate it
in the future. NPA also has a feature that allows you to save your 
preferences between logins.
See the <a href="#user">user registration page</A> for
more information.<P>

<h3><A name="FAQ"> Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the NASA Planck
Archive (NPA)</a></h3>

<h3>Interface questions</h3>

<dl>
<dt>What does NPA/ESZ/ECC mean?
<dd>Here are some common definitions. This is the NASA Planck Archive (NPA).
The ERCSC stands for the Early Release Compact Source Catalog.  In addition,
there are two source catalogs based on multifrequency detection algorithms
which are included with the Planck early release.  These are the Early 
Release SZ Cluster Catalog (ESZ) and the Early Release Galactic Cold Cores
catalog (ECC). <P>

<dt>What's the file format that I need to use for the search-by-file
upload?
<dd>See <a

here</A>.<P>

<dt>I did a search, left the NPA window up, and now that I've come
back to this session, it's in a funny state and does not appear to be
responding as it should. Why?
<DD>Sometimes, if there is a network hiccup (e.g., you pick up and
      move your laptop to a different wireless hub), the NPA can be left in
      a funny state.  Please exit the tab in your browser and restart your session

<P>&nbsp;<P>


<A NAME="terminology"><!-- --></A><H3>Planck Mission</H3>

The Planck Telescope observes the entire sky at
frequencies ranging from 30 - 857 GHz. 
The
initial release of Planck data is a set of source
catalogs in each of the wavelength ranges characteristic
of Planck's instrument complement. Users have full access       
to the Planck catalogs, and the archive enables sorting and
selection of columns of data characteristics. However, the initial
release of Planck images is limited to cutouts of the single wavelength
mosaic images in regions within 4 full-widths at half-maximum (FWHM)
of the Point Spread Function (PSF)
for the Planck catalog sources. 
These images are provided in JPEG format only. (The JPEG cutouts 
will be replaced by FITS files that can be manipulated using the NPA visualization
tools once the maps on which the images are based have been released to the 
public.) Note 
that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has been modeled 
and removed from all images regardless of their location in 
the sky. CMB information will be available at a later time.<P>


<A NAME="searching"><!-- --></A><H3>Searches -- The basics of searching</H3>

Searching the archive is straightforward; the available 
searches can be seen by clicking on the "Searches" menu option.  The
position search, available under the heading "Multiple Wavelength (Name/Position)"
is the most commonly used, and is the default.  Target names
can be automatically resolved into coordinates using NED or SIMBAD, or
you can specify celestial coordinates. 
You can also specify the search radius in arcseconds, arcminutes or degrees.  
Other
search options are described in detail <a
href="#searches">on the page on searching</A>.<P>

Planck observations cover the entire sky. You may request 
single wavelength all-sky catalogs or multi-wavelength information
on single targets.  (See the page on <a
href="#results">understanding your search results</A> for more
information.)<P>

You may wish to filter your search results; see
<a href="#filter">this page</A> for more information on
filtering.<P>

A multi-wavelength (positional) search will return the rows of the catalog selected by the
input parameters, together with preview images.
In the lower portion of the NPA window, images of Planck sources
will appear:  data from Planck (JPEG only), WMAP (FITS), and 
IRAS (FITS) will be depicted. See the page on  <a
href="#visualization">visualization</A> for more information on
the options within the visualization tabs.<P> 



<A NAME="catalogs"><!-- --></A><H3>Catalogs -- Retrieving and using catalogs</H3>

You can choose from several catalogs to load in
preparation for overlaying on your <a
href="#visualization">visualized data</A>. By clicking on the
"Catalogs" menu option, a pop-up window appears with several options, as
follows. Note that you cannot overlay catalog sources on the Planck
JPEG images. <P>

The target name is (by default) the one for the current search with
which you are working. If you would like to change the center of the
search for purposes of the catalog search, click on "modify target"
and enter the new information.  All of the same parameters as for a
position search of the NPA appear.<P>

You can then choose catalogs based first on the "project" under which
they are housed at IRSA: 2MASS, IRAS, Spitzer (delivered Legacy
catalogs), MSX, COSMOS, DENIS, USNO, or BOLOCAM.  The options under 
"category" and the specific clickable catalog change according to the
project.  A short description is provided for each of the catalogs.<P>

Click on "Search" to initiate the search.<b>NOTE </b> that the search
may take a long time to return, and you may think that nothing has
happened, but be patient and eventually it will return a tab.<P>

Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Searches that retrieve many rows
will take even longer.<P>

If the catalog search is successful, it will return the results in a
tab of their own, in an interface similar to the other data tabs. You
can save the catalog search results to your local disk for future use
by clicking on the "Save" button. <P> 


<A NAME="download"><!-- --></A><H3>Background Monitor -- Downloading
data and catalogs in the background</H3>

<DL>
<DT><em>Downloading data</em><P>

<DD>After deciding what data to download, click the checkboxes to pick
specific data files to download, and then click "Prepare Download" to
begin the  packaging and downloading process.  A pop-up window will
appear in order to define exactly what kinds of data you would like to
have packaged. Clicking OK initiates this process.<P>

After you click ok, the Background Monitor appears as a panel in your
window to keep track of the data download.  This panel can also be called
up by selecting the "Background Monitor" link on the screen.  You can watch
your data being packaged, and when the data are available for
download, the system will update that panel, providing a link for downloading
the packaged data.<P>

<strong>Important note</strong>: don't log in to another session while the system 
is preparing a download! If you log in during a download, as far 
as the system is concerned,
you will have changed identities (from 'anonymous' to 'jones', say), and as a 
result the system won't complete preparing the download.<P>

<dt><em>Downloading catalogs</em><P>
<dd>In a future version of the NPA, the Background Monitor will also
keep track of catalog downloads for you. <P>
</DL><P>


<A NAME="preferences"><!-- --></A><H3>Preferences -- Setting and using your preferences</H3>

The preferences menu option provides a few ways to customize the user
interface.  The pop-up window that appears when you click this option
gives you a choice of the number of entries that appear in
the table by default, and allows you to enter your email for an email
notification when data are packaged. You can also set the units for the default distance
readout to either degrees or arcminutes.<P>

<h3>Searching the NASA Planck Archive</h3>

There are two options for searching the NASA Planck
Archive (NPA). You can search the multiple wavelength data by position or you can
filter all of the data to see the results by frequency. <P>

<em>Contents:</em><BR>
+<A href="#commonoptions">Options Common to Most Searches</A><br>
+<A href="#byPosition">Position Search</A><br>
+<A href="#byWavelength">Frequency Search</A><br>
+<A href="#byTable">Table Upload</A><br>
<P>&nbsp;<P>


<A NAME="commonoptions"><!-- --></A><H3>Options Common to Most Searches</H3>

The individual search options are given below, in the same order in
which they appear in the search pane.  By default, searches return a table of
Planck sources, but the table is not sorted by distance of a source from
the coordinate.  To do that, you must click on the column labeled "dist". 
Most of the search panes have the following additional options:

<DL>

A multi-wavelength (position) search will return the rows of the catalog selected by the
input parameters, together with preview images.
When you do a search, the results are displayed in tabs, and each of
these tabs correspond to the selected parameters.  
Most of these tabs display a single Planck instrument frequency band. Two additional
tabs based on multifrequency detection algorithms
identify "Early Release" SZ clusters (ESZ)
and Galactic Cold Cores (ECC). Each of these tables has many columns
with positional, photometric, and size information about the source
in question. The ESZ and ECC catalogs contain all the Planck data on
each source as well as a variety of derived properties for these
objects.<P>

After you search the first time, the search pane collapses under an
orange bar so the results of your search can be displayed.  To search
again, just click on the bar to reopen the search pane.<P>



<A NAME="byPosition"><!-- --></A><H3>Position Search</H3>

To perform a position search, enter the coordinates of your central 
position and the radius of the cone (circle) within which you want
to see Planck results. All observations meeting your entered criteria
that are within the specified radius will be returned.

Alternatively, you may enter a target name and have either 
NED or SIMBAD resolve the
name into coordinates. These coordinates can be in decimal degrees or
in hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss format.<P>

To enter a search radius, type in the number and select the units ---
arcseconds, arcminutes, or degrees --- from the pulldown menu.

<A NAME="byTable"><!-- --></A>    
The position search can also be done in "batch mode", using a list of
positions supplied in a file. The file must be in 
<a href = "http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"> IPAC table </a>
format, which is basically ASCII text with headers explaining the type of data in 
each column, separated by vertical bars. 
IRSA's 
<a href = "http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblCheck/">  TblCheck </a> tool will validate your input 
file and convert many types of standard ASCII files to IPAC table format.

A sample input file looks like this: <P>

</pre><P>

The NPA parses on spaces, so a space is the delimiter between fields. 
Therefore, if there is a space in your object name (e.g., "NGC 1001"
versus "NGC1001") or position ("34.23 45.45" versus "34d23m45.45s"), you
need to put quotes (single or double) around the target name or its position.

provides information about the acceptable format for entering position information.
<p>



<A NAME="byWavelength"><!-- --></A><H3>Single Wavelength (all-sky)</H3>

Instead of searching by individual positions, you may also view the
all-sky Planck catalog for each frequency band. The bands range from 
30 GHz to 857 GHz and can be selected with the pull-down menu. Content 
filtering
on the all-sky catalog columns can be performed by clicking on the 
"Set Column Selections and Filters" link. This pops up a window in which you can
select either the short or the long form for the catalog display (long
form has more columns), select the individual columns to be displayed,
and set constraints on individual column values
(see <a href="#filter">Filtering</A> for more
information).<P>

eleven tabs: one for each of the nine Planck frequency ranges and two
for the catalogs based on multifrequency detection algorithms
of the Early Release (ESZ, ECC). 
You should make the browser wide enough to see all the
11 different tabs in the result panel. You can also
drag the little light blue triangle to adjust the widths of the panels.<p> 
Clicking each tab reveals the table of Planck sources for that frequency band
within the designated search zone. 
The ESZ and ECC tabs show the catalog entries for the Early Release SZ 
clusters (ESZ) and Cold Cores in the same regions,

factor of 7 resolution change between 30 and 857 GHz will result in
different sized "postage stamp" images around individual sources since
the image size is set at four times the beam FWHM at each wavelength.
WMAP and IRAS images are also shown for each table entry. <P>


<A NAME="filter"><!-- --></A><H3>Filtering -- Imposing additional
filters to get the most out of your search results</H3>

In order to quickly sort through what information 
appears in the results tab and to examine the source you care about,
<em>filters</em> are a very powerful tool. <P>

To add a new filter, click on "Add filters". Each of the  
columns currently displayed can be selected in a pulldown menu, 
and a selection operation performed on the entries in the column.
If you select a field with a limited set of
choices, an additional pulldown appears with those limited choices.<P>

For example, if you have searched on a position and would like to
view only the Planck sources with more than 3 observations, select
'numobs', '>' from the relevant pulldown menu, enter '3' in the text box, then
"ADD" the filter and "APPLY" it to your search results.
The screen will then display only the objects at the position you
specified which have been observed more than 3 times.

To remind you that a filter has been applied to the results, a notice
is displayed on the top right of the search results pane.

Note that each tab (that is, each of the nine Planck frequencies plus ESZ and
ECC) has its own, independent filter. If you want to see the objects with more
than 3 observations in 30 GHz, 44 GHz, and 857 GHz, you'll need to apply
the filter three different times.
You can add additional filters to further restrict your list of
sources.<P>

<h3>The Details Pane: Getting More Information on a Row In Your Search
Results from the NASA Planck Archive</h3>

After you have <a href="#searching">searched the archive</A> and
<a href="#results">explored the tabs in your search results</A>,
you will be interested in understanding the additional information
that appears in the Details pane on the right side of your screen when a row in the table
(for any tab) is highlighted.  <P>

The contents of the Details pane change according to which tab you
have in the foreground. <P>

From the tab, click on any row (note: no need to select the
checkbox on the far left of the row). The row becomes highlighted in
green. The details pane on the right side of the window changes
accordingly. <P>

The Details tab that appears contains notes about the selected source.  This
typically states association between an ERCSC source and a source detected
in other catalogs, such as WMAP, GB6 or IRAS.  <P>

<h3>Visualizing data in the NASA Planck Archive</h3>

Once a search is complete, the lower portion of the NPA window
is populated with three rows of images. The top row consists
of Planck images from each frequency band, with frequency increasing
from left to right. 

These images appear as a grey background and contain a
mosaic of JPEG images for all the Planck sources found within this zone. The mosaics are
constructed from maps with a model for the cosmic microwave background subtracted. The
individual "postage stamp" Planck JPEGs are each four times the beam FWHM on a side at 33
GHz. However , for each source, data is included only for a region corresponding to four
times the beam FWHM at the corresponding frequency. Thus, those regions with data in the
postage stamps will vary in size by a factor of 7 between 30 and 857 GHz.


The Planck images can be downloaded by selecting Planck sources
from the search results table, clicking the "Prepare Download" button,
and making sure that the "Planck" box is checked in the list of cutout
images to download. They cannot be further manipulated inside the NPA,
however.<P>

Below the row of Planck mosaics, there are two additional rows of
images showing the search region as seen by WMAP and IRAS. These
images contain markers showing the positions of Planck catalog
sources from the frequency range selected.
Unlike the Planck images, the WMAP and IRAS images are FITS files, and
clicking on the images will launch the FITS viewer described below.
These images can also be downloaded to your computer (as described
previously) by ensuring that the WMAP and IRAS boxes are checked
in the "Download Options" window that pops up after selecting
"Prepare Download". <P>


<H3><A NAME="fitsViewer">Viewer</A></H3>

All of the interactive image visualization tools work the same 
way. Here we describe the FITS image viewer; we 
describe the visualization tools and their options below. Note that the
viewer only works for FITS files. Since the Planck images are JPEGs,
they can't be used with the viewer.<P>

Note also that you may need to expand your browser window to see 
all the results. <P>

<dl>
<dt><em>Interactive exploration of the image with the mouse.</em> 
<dd>Move your
mouse over any image that is loaded into the viewer. A pop-up
window appears, and some information is updated in real time (such as
coordinates); some information (such as flux densities) is updated
when you stop moving your mouse for a second or two.  The image can be
interactively investigated in this fashion.  <P>

<dt><em>Finding out what image is displayed.</em> 
<dd>The top of the window pane (just under the tab headings) gives a
title of the image. This abbreviation may be a little cryptic; 
ISSA or IRIS are both IRAS data, along with the corresponding wavelength;
WMAP cutouts give the band name as well as the band frequency.  <P>

<dt><img src="breakout.gif"> <em>Breaking the image out of the pane.</em>
<dd>This icon will pull the corresponding visualization window out into a
pop-up window.  This enables you to look at more than one
visualization window at a time.<P>
</dl>

<H3><A NAME="VisualizationTools">Visualization Tools</A></H3>

When you click on the image (or the header of the image, 
the "Visualization Tools" toolbar pops-up.  Here's a description of the tools. 

<dl>
<dt><img src="save.gif"> <em>Saving the FITS file.</em> 
<dd>The diskette icon will download the current background FITS image
to your local disk.  Note that <b>you</b> control where the image is
saved on your disk through your browser; your browser may be
configured to store all downloads in a particular location on your
disk. <P>

<dt><img src="colortable.gif"> <em>Changing the color table.</em> 
<dd>Click on the colorful icon to change the color table of the
background image. A wide variety of color table choices appear when
you click the button, and you can select your new color table.
For the IRAS and WMAP cutouts, we use the color table
"For false color", 5th from the top in color tables. <p>
Here is the detailed
explanation of that default color table:
Starting with black, fade up in blue to index 68.  At index 17 start to fade in green along with the blue.  At index 68 continue fading up the green while fading the blue down.  At index 102 start fading in red while continuing to fade out blue.  Continue to fade up red until index 187 - at this point, green is almost gone and blue is completely gone. At index 204 it is red only.  From index 204 fade in both green and blue until all three colors are on full at index 255. 

<dt><img src="stretch1.gif"> <em>Changing the color table stretch.</em>
<dd>Click on this icon to change the specific stretch of the color table
to one of several pre-defined standard options.<P>

<dt><img src="stretch2.gif"> <em>Customizing the color table stretch.</em>
<dd>Click on this icon to customize the specific stretch of the color
table.  A pop-up window appears with a histogram of the colors, and
you can interactively change and customize the stretch of the data as
displayed.<P>

<dt><img src="fitsheader.gif"> <em>Viewing the FITS header.</em>
<dd>This icon
will display a pop-up window with the FITS header of the background
image. 

<dt><img src="layers.gif"> <em>Viewing/changing the order of the layers on
the image.</em> 
<dd>If you've been following along by trying these various
options, you now have an image with a lot of annotations on it. If you
click this icon, you will get a pop-up window with a list of all the
layers you have on top of the image. Here you can change what is
displayed and what colors get used for it. <P>

<dt><img src="zoomdisplay.gif">  
<dd>This is not actually clickable, but is instead letting you know
the magnification factor for the image as displayed.  To zoom, use the
zoom icons: a magnifying glass with plus or minus sign inside. These are 
described elsewhere in this help document.  Note that there is a maximum 
zoom allowed -- 64 times. To enlarge things more than that, please select another
background image, one of smaller spatial extent.<P>

<dt><img src="help.gif"> <em>Getting help.</em> 
<dd>  Clicking on this icon
takes you to this help page.<P>

<dt><img src="lockorchange.gif"> <em>Locking or changing the background

<dd>You can lock the background image or change it to be
something else by clicking on this image.<P>

<dt><img src="zoominout.gif"> <em>Zooming in or out.</em>  <dd>
Clicking on these magnifying glass icons zooms you in or out of the
image (or spectrum). The readout of how many times you are zoomed
appears at the top of the visualization window.  Note that there is a
maximum zoom allowed -- 64 times. To enlarge things more than that,
please select another background image, one of smaller spatial
extent.<P>

<dt><img src="grid.gif"> <em>Adding a coordinate grid.</em> 
<dd>  Click on this
icon to overlay a coordinate grid on the image. Click it again to
remove it.<P>

<dt><img src="selectregion.gif"> <em>Selecting a region.</em> 
<dd>When you
click this icon, at first, nothing seems to happen. However, you can
now click and drag in the image, selecting a box on the image. This
box can be resized by grabbing and dragging the corners of the box.
When you have selected a region of the image, additional icons appear
above the image. These icons will allow you to crop the image to the
selected region (<img src="crop.gif">) or obtain statistics on the
region (<img src="statistics.gif">). <P>

<dt><img src="northup.gif"> <em>Rotating the image so that North is
up</em>.  
<dd>Images that you download from IRAS or DSS or 2MASS commonly
are already oriented such that North is up. However, when
interactively investigating Planck products, North is not necessarily
up.  The Planck images and mosaics are constructed to optimize the
resultant size of the mosaic.   However, when interactively
investigating the image, it may be helpful to orient North up, and
this icon does that.<P>

<dt><img src="line.gif"> <em>Measuring a distance.</em> 
<dd>When you
click this icon, at first, nothing seems to happen. However, you can
now "draw" a line on the image, and the length of the line is
displayed.<P>

<dt><img src="current-target_20x20.png"> <em> Center image.</em> 
<dd>When you click this icon,
the image will be centered at the current
query position.<P>

<!-- NOT IMPLEMEMTED
<dt><img src="readout.gif"> <em>Changing the location of the interactive
readout.</em>  
<dd>You can interactively explore the image by moving
the mouse (see above).  Clicking on this icon changes the direction in
which the pop-up window appears. By default, the readout attempts to
appear generally to the right of the visualized image.  Clicking once
changes the arrow to pointing down, and the readout attempts to appear
generally below the visualized image, and similarly for additional
clicks and additional directions.<P> 

<dt><img src="chooseimage.gif"> <em>Changing the background image.</em>  
<dd>By default, the NPA tries to pick a good background image, but you
may wish to try another wavelength or field of view. By clicking on
this icon, you bring up a pop-up window.  The first part of this
window shows the central RA/Dec that you are about to request (you can
change this by clicking on "Modify Target" and all the usual options
appear). The next part of this window has a series of tabs: ISSA/IRIS
(which is IRAS -- 12, 25, 60, and 100 microns), 2MASS (J, H, and Ks
bands, or 1.25, 1.65, and 2.17 microns), MSX (8.28, 12.13, 14.65, and
21.3 microns), DSS (the usual red/blue plates and a variety of scan
options), a FITS file from your local disk, or a URL that you can
enter so the browser can retrieve a FITS file from the web.  From this
pop-up, you can also choose to create a 3-color image, loading a new
FITS file separately for each color plane. Note that this 3-color
option only appears for background images, not Planck data, unless
you have loaded Planck data from disk.<P>
