<h3>IRSA/WISE Image Service: Overview</h3>

The IRSA/WISE Image Service is the final repository for all of the
data collected by WISE.  The most detailed description about the acquisition, 
processing, and calibration of WISE data can be found in the Explanatory Supplements 
for the <a href="http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky/expsup/" target="_blank">
All-Sky Data Release </a>, <a href="http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky/expsup/sec7_1.html" target="_blank">3-Band Cryo Data Release</a>, <a href="http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky/expsup/sec8_1.html" target="_blank">Post-Cryo Preliminary Data Release</a>, and 
<a href="http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/prelim/expsup/" target="_blank"> Preliminary Data Release </a> Products, respectively. <P>


<h3>The Spacecraft and Instruments</h3>

The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer was launched on a Delta II
rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base into a sun-synchronous orbit on 
December 14, 2009. Consisting of a 0.4-meter telescope and a camera 
designed for simultaneous imaging at four infrared bands, WISE 
mapped the sky in the mid-infrared at sensitivities over 100 times
that of the previous all-sky surveys. The 1024 by 1024 pixel
HgCdTe and Si:As detectors on WISE obtained critically sampled images at 
wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 microns (also referred to as W1, W2, W3, and W4, 
respectively) with spatial resolution ranging
from 6 arcseconds at the shortest wavelength to 12 arcseconds at the
longest. The two shortest wavelength bands are optimized for the detection
of low temperature brown dwarfs and stellar photospheres. The two longer 
wavelength bands sample the mid-infrared spectral energy distribution of 
warm dust around star-forming galaxies, asteroids, and stars with 
circumstellar material.

<h3>Terminology</h3>

Various sets of WISE image data are available for download. 

Various multiband catalog source lists are also available, for both the 
Preliminary and All-Sky release.  
These are accessible
through the IRSA Gator Catalog Tool <a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/" target="_blank">http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/</A>.
<P>

<h3>Searching, Results, and Filters</h3>

Several search options are provided, which are documented in more
detail <a href="searching.html">here</A>.  Searching by
position is the most popular search.  <P>

The search results appear in a table in the top right pane of the search results window.
They will include basic information about all the WISE images which
fulfill your search criteria. Note that there will be a separate table
entry for each WISE band, so the total number of images in the table
will be four times the number of WISE framesets or coadds available
for the queried region. The listed FITS images can be downloaded by checking
the box at the beginning of each row and clicking "Prepare download". 
(See the page on <a href="results.html">understanding
your search results</A> for more information.)<P>

Filters, either imposed on your initial search or via <a
href="results.html#filter">your results page</A>, can provide a
powerful tool for narrowing down search results to the observations you
want.  For example, you can restrict your search to just one
wavelength range by unclicking the other bands. By clicking the
"Add Filters" box in the results table pane, it is possible to add
criteria to your image search using the tools in the "Filters
Dialog" window. <P>


<h3>Visualization</h3>

The WISE images 
found by the search are displayed below
the search result table. If a single position search was used,
this position will be highlighted in a blue box in the center of the
field of view. Note that the resolution for WISE band 4 (W4) is 
half that of W1 (12 versus 6 arcsec), and the coadd resolution is
substantially worse than that for single frames in all bands.
The position and number of images which fulfill the search are
depicted as an overlay on an IRAS 100 micron image in the "Coverage"
pane. A second tab in this pane displays a 3 color mosaic of the
WISE images.<P>

See <a href="visualization.html">the visualization page</A> for more
on visualization.<P>

<h3>Downloading Data</h3>

After deciding which data to download, click on the corresponding
checkbox on the left side, and click "Prepare Download" to begin the
packaging and data download process -- the download then gets passed
to a background job for packaging.  See <a
href="basics.html#download">the page on the Background Monitor</A> for
more information.<P>

<h3>User Preferences</h3>

The IRSA/WISE Image Service can remember you
and your <a href="basics.html#preferences">preferences</A> when you
return.  See the <a href="user.html">user registration page</A> for
more information.<P>
