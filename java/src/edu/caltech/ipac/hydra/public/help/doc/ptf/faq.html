<dt>What does WISE Level 3/Level 1b/Preliminary Release mean?
<dd>Here are some common definitions. 
WISE is the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, a 40-cm diameter
cryogenically cooled space telescope that mapped the sky at
3.3, 4.5, 12, and 23 microns during 2010. This web application
accesses the IRSA/WISE Image Service, the repository of image
data from the WISE mission. Level 3 refers to
image or source data derived from coaddition of the individual 9.9 
second WISE exposures. The individual frames are known as Level 1b data.
The vast majority of the sky will have coadded images assembled from
eight or more Level 1b frames. The WISE Preliminary Release refers
to the initial set of WISE data made public in April 2011, consisting
of images and source catalogs from a contiguous 57% of the sky. The
four bands imaged by WISE are referred to as W1 (3.3 microns), W2 (4.5
microns), W3 (12 microns), and W4 (22 microns).<P>

<h3>File questions</h3>

<dl>
<dt>What do I do with the zip files I get when I download data?
<dd>To uncompress the files you have downloaded, type "unzip
foo.zip". To uncompress multiple files at once, type "unzip '*.zip'"
(the single quotes are important), or "unzip \*.zip" -- you just have
to escape out the wildcard.<P>
