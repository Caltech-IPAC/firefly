<dt><i>What's the file format that I need to use for the Multi-Objects search?</i>

</DL>



<h3>File questions</h3>

<dl>
<dt><i>What do I do with the zip files I get when I download data?</i>
<dd>To uncompress the files you have downloaded, type "unzip
foo.zip". To uncompress multiple files at once, type "unzip '*.zip'"
