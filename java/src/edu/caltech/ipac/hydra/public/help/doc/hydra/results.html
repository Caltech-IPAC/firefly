<A NAME="terminology"><!-- --></A><H3>Terminology</H3>

This is a Hydra Based  Image Service.<P>

The service provides an interface to access images 
in each wavelength band and to determine which catalog
sources are within these images.
Following a search, you will see a results page resembling the example shown below, 
consisting of three main panes: the results pane, the coverage pane and the image display. 
The exact appearance of the results page, e.g. the various tabs on each pane and the number 
and types of images displayed, will vary slightly
depending on the search type. The positional
search results can appear in a number of tabs.
Each tab provides a different look at the data retrieved by your search.

<dl>
<dt><em>Downloading Data</em>
<dd>In order to download the images, click 
on the checkbox to the left of
the entry you want to download, and then click on the "Prepare
Download" button at the top of the column.  The <a
href="basics.html#download">Background Monitor</A> is then launched to
prepare your data for download. When your packaged data are ready,
save your data to disk. <P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. <P>

<dt><em>Coverage </em>
<dd> 
For a single target positional search, the coverage 
tab in the coverage pane displays the footprint
of the resulting images which contain the search target overlaid on another image.
Only the images displayed in the current page are overlayed in the coverage tab.
You can change the page size or add filters to the results to get different set
of images overlaid.

<P>

<dt><em>Saving the results</em>
<dd>The search results can be saved to a
text file by clicking the "Save" button or viewed as a text file by
clicking the "as Text" button.<P>

<dt><em>Filtering</em>
<dd>Filters can be added interactively -- see <a
href="#filter">Filtering</A> below for more information.<P>

<dt><a name="newcolumns"><em>Adding/removing columns</em></A>
<dd>Several columns of information on each data set are automatically displayed 
in each of these tabs by default. Additional columns 
can be added/removed by clicking on the "Edit Table Options" Icon (small grid on the far upper
right corner of the results pane <img src="table_options.gif">). 
The results can be sorted by clicking on any column's name.
See <a href="columns.html">Columns</A> for details on column definition. All column information is 
presented in the "Details" tab of the coverage pane for the selected (highlighted in green) observation.<P>

<dt><em>Changing the number of rows</em>
<dd>By default, 50 rows are returned
per page; more or fewer rows can be displayed by changing the Page Size number
in the "Edit Table Options" menu <img src="table_options.gif">, or by changing the Table Page Size entry in 
the Preferences tab. You can scroll through search results pages by the
arrows in the middle of the results table tab header. 
Do you have too many rows?  Further
restrict the search by imposing additional <a
href="#filter">filtering</A>; see below!<P>

<dt><em>Changing the size of the window or columns</em>
<dd>You can click and drag to resize the window pane or individual
columns.<P>

<dt><em>View Options</em>
<dd>You can chose between "Table View" and "Grid View" (icons in the top right corner of the results page) 
to display the search results. "Table View" lists the available observations in table format in the results 
pane and only 
displays the images associated with the currently selected image set (highlighted in green in the results pane 
table). Alternatively, "Grid View" simply displays all of the images of the search results. Note that the 
artifact overlay (accessed via the "Plot Layers" tab) is not available in "Grid View".  
<P>

</dl>

<A NAME="results"><!-- --></A><H3>Position Search Results</H3>

After a positional <a href="searching.html">search</A>, the results 
pane in the browser  window will contain
one or more tabs depending on the image data requested.

Clicking on
the tab reveals a table with one row for each of the images which fulfills your search criteria. 
Note that there will be a separate table entry for each image for the queried region. 
Columns provide basic image information.
In addition 
to the preselected subset of default columns, all available information on a given image 
can be accessed under the "Details" tab of the coverage pane. 
Once a positional search is completed and images are displayed,
a Catalog Search can be performed to indicate the presence of
catalog sources within the images. 
The visualization seen in the lower portion of
the browser window (the image display pane) will change depending on which source is selected.
The selected source is highlighted in green in the table of
search results. When overlaying the source detections of a catalog search, note that only the sources of the 
current results page are displayed. Select another page or increase the page size to see additional 
source overlays.  <P>

<em>Column Headings</em>: The columns displayed in the search results
tables can be modified. Click on the "Edit Table Options" icon <img src="table_options.gif"> in the top right corner
of the results pane to change the columns shown. 
See <a href="columns.html">Columns</A> for details on column definition. All column information is 
presented in the "Details" tab of the coverage pane for the selected (highlighted in green) observation. <P>

Do you have too many rows?  Further restrict the search by imposing
additional <a href="#filter">filtering</A>; see below!<P>

<A NAME="results"><!-- --></A><H3>Solar System Search Results</H3>

<p>The output of the Solar System Object/Orbit search is similar to
the positional image search results, but the table of results is slightly
different. Note that the results of the solar system search are by default displayed 
in "Grid View".

</p><p><strong>Image Previews</strong>:  Search results include image
previews of the resulting images in which the position of the input
object is predicted to have been covered at the time of observation.
The predicted position is indicated by a blue square on the image. An orange 
"x" indicates the predicted position of the input object in previous or subsequent 
image sets. Clicking on any of the positions will highlight (in blue) all the 
corresponding positions in the surrounding images. 
</p>

</p><p><strong>Orbital Path Coverage </strong>: The Orbital Path Coverage Tab in 
the coverage pane displays the orbital path (blue line) of the input object during the 
entire mission (unless time limits were provided as part of the search). The coverage
of the orbital path is indicated by orange "x" symbols.  

<p><strong>Results Table</strong>:  The table of results provides a
list of all Single Exposure (level 1b) images in which the predicted
position of the input moving object is predicted to appear, given the
input orbital path. Similar to other search results, the table contains
one row for each Single Exposure image, and Exposures are grouped
together by exposure number.  Selecting one row within a group will
highlight all the associated rows and update the preview images.</p>

<p>The columns in the Results Table are defined as follows:</p>

<ul>

<p><em>band</em>:  The band of the image </p>

  <p><em>equinox</em>:  The equinox of returned position (usually J2000.0)</p>

    <p><em>scan_id</em>:  The scan_id of the returned image,
      which provides identification of pole-to-pole orbit scan for
      observation</p>

      <p><em>frame_num</em>:  The WISE frame_num of the returned
      image, which indicates identification of frame number within a given scan.</p>

      <p><em>date_obs</em>: UT observation date in standard format
      date-hms </p>

      <p><em>mjd_obs</em>:  julian date of observation midpoint</p>

      <p><em>ra_obj/dec_obj</em>:  The predicted RA and Dec of the object based upon
      the input orbital parameters and the observation date/time. </p>

      <p><em>sun_dist</em>: The predicted distance from the Sun (in
      AU) of the object based upon the input orbital parameters and
      the observation date/time.</p>

      <p><em>geo_dist</em>: The predicted distance from the Earth (in
      AU) of the object based upon the input orbital parameters and
      the observation date/time. </p>

      <p><em>dist_ctr</em>:  The distance of the predicted object
  position within the Single Exposure image from the center of that
  image.  Thus, if the predicted object position is far from the
  object center it is possible that small differences in orbital parameter
  could have caused a different image to be selected.  </p>

  <p><em>vmag</em>: The total visual magnitude of the object
based on its relative orbit parameters and observation date/time.  This
parameter is null (99.99) for Manual Input searches. </p>


</ul>
<p>Similar to other search results, rows of the table can be selected by the checkboxes on
the left and then downloaded using the Prepare Download button.  
</p>


<A NAME="visualization"><!-- --></A><H3>Visualization</H3>

Following the positional search, the images of the selected 
entry in the search results table will be displayed in the lower portion 
of the browser window.  The entry position highlighted in green 
is centered in each wavelength image field of view and target positions are indicated with a blue circle 
overlay on the image. Note that there is a
factor of two resolution change between 3.4 and 22 microns. <P>
Please refer to the help section on <a href="visualization.html">visualization</a> for more information. 

<A NAME="filter"><!-- --></A><H3>Filtering -- Imposing additional
filters to get the most out of your search results</H3>

Even if your search returned only one source, you could have literally
hundreds of columns that appear in the source catalogs. 
In order to quickly weed through which information 
appears in the tab and examine the source you care about,
<em>filters</em> are a very powerful tool. <P>

Click on "Add filters" in order to add a new filter. Each of your
current columns can be selected in a pulldown menu, as well as an
operation (=, <, etc).  If you select a field with a limited set of
choices, an additional pulldown appears with those limited choices.<P>


You can add additional filters to further restrict your list of
sources.<P>
