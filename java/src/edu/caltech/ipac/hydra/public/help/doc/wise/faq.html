<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the IRSA/WISE Image
Service </h3>

<h3>Interface questions</h3>

<dl>
<dt><i>What does WISE Level 3 and Level 1b refer to?</i>
<dd> 
WISE is the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, a 40-cm diameter
cryogenically cooled space telescope that mapped the sky at
3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 microns during 2010. This web application
accesses the IRSA/WISE Image Service, the repository of image
data from the WISE mission. Level 3 refers to
image or source data derived from coaddition of the individual 
WISE exposures. The individual frames are known as Level 1b data.
The vast majority of the sky will have coadded atlas images assembled from
eight or more Level 1b frames.<P> 

<dt><i>What is the difference between the different WISE Data Releases?</i>
<dd>

The WISE All-Sky Data Release incorporates data taken during the cryogenic phase of the mission. Release data products include the Single Exposure Images for bands W1, W2, W3, and W4, an Atlas of match-filtered, calibrated and coadded image sets, and a Source Working Database containing positions and 4-band photometry. The Release products were generated via second-pass processing using the WISE Science Data System and benefited from improvements to calibration, processing parameters and algorithms compared to the first-pass processing of the Preliminary Data Release. <P>


The WISE 3-Band Cryo Data Release incorporates data taken between August 6 and September 29, 2010. Release data products include an Atlas of match-filtered, calibrated and coadded image sets, a Source Working Database containing positions and 3-band photometry. The Release products were generated through second-pass processing using the WISE Science Data System that benefited from improvements to calibration, processing parameters and algorithms that were made to produce the WISE All-Sky Data Release.<P>

The WISE Post-Cryo Preliminary Release consists of Single-Exposure images (no coadded atlas images !!!) taken during the post-cryo phase of the mission between 29 September 2010 and 1 February 2011.
The Post-Cryo Preliminary Single-Exposure Images were produced during first-pass data processing during WISE on-orbit operations, as input for the WISE Moving Object Pipeline.<P>

The WISE Preliminary Release refers
to the initial set of WISE data made public in April 2011, consisting
of images and source catalogs from a contiguous 57% of the sky (with first-pass processing). The
four bands imaged by WISE are referred to as W1 (3.4 microns), W2 (4.6
microns), W3 (12 microns), and W4 (22 microns).<P>


<dt><i>What's the file format that I need to use for the Multi-Objects search?</i>
<dd>Your multi-object search table must be in IPAC table format. Examples and more details are provided <a href="searching.html#byPosition">here</A>.<P>

</DL>



<h3>File questions</h3>

<dl>
<dt><i>What do I do with the zip files I get when I download data?</i>
<dd>To uncompress the files you have downloaded, type "unzip
foo.zip". To uncompress multiple files at once, type "unzip '*.zip'"
(the single quotes are important), or "unzip \*.zip" -- you just have
to escape out the wildcard.<P>
