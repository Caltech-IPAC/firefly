<h3>Image Service: Overview</h3>

This is an Hydra Based Image Service. It provides the basic search and
data browsing functions to the image archive and 

<h3>Searching, Results, and Filters</h3>

Several search options are provided, which are documented in more
detail <a href="searching.html">here</A>.  Searching by
position is the most popular search.  <P>

The search results appear in a table in the top pane of the search results window.
They will include basic information about all the images which
fulfill your search criteria.  Note that there will be an entry for each image.  
The listed FITS images can be downloaded by checking
the box at the beginning of each row and clicking "Prepare download". 
(See the page on <a href="results.html">understanding
your search results</A> for more information.)<P>

Filters, either imposed on your initial search or via <a
href="results.html#filter">your results page</A>, can provide a
powerful tool for narrowing down search results to the observations you
want.  For example, you can restrict your search to just one
wavelength range by unclicking the other bands. By clicking the
"Add Filters" box in the results table pane, it is possible to add
criteria to your image search using the tools in the "Filters
Dialog" window. <P>


<h3>Visualization</h3>

The images 
found by the search are displayed below
the search result table. If a single position search was used,
this position will be highlighted in a blue box in the center of the
field of view. 

The position and number of images which fulfill the search are
depicted as an overlay on another image in the "Coverage"
pane. There could be a tab in this pane displays a 3 color mosaic of the
images.<P>

See <a href="visualization.html">the visualization page</A> for more
on visualization.<P>

<h3>Downloading Data</h3>

After deciding which data to download, click on the corresponding
checkbox on the left side, and click "Prepare Download" to begin the
packaging and data download process -- the download then gets passed
to a background job for packaging.  See <a
href="basics.html#download">the page on the Background Monitor</A> for
more information.<P>

<h3>User Preferences</h3>

The Image Service can remember you
and your <a href="basics.html#preferences">preferences</A> when you
return.  See the <a href="user.html">user registration page</A> for
more information.<P>
